      "abstract": "Alterations in Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can reflect autonomic dysfunction associated with neurodegeneration. We investigate the influence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) on HR and its variability measures in the Indian population by designing a complete signal processing pipeline to detect the R-wave peaks and compute HR and HRV features from ECG recordings of 10 seconds, for point-of-care applications. The study cohort involves 297 urban participants, among which 48.48% are male and 51.51% are female. From the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III), MCI is detected in 19.19% of participants and the rest, 80.8% of them are cognitively healthy. Statistical features like central tendency (mean and root mean square (RMS) of the Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals) and dispersion (standard deviation (SD) of all NN intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences of NN intervals (RMSSD)) of beat-to-beat intervals are computed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test reveals that mean of NN intervals (p = 0.0021), the RMS of NN intervals (p = 0.0014), the SDNN (p = 0.0192) and the RMSSD (p = 0.0206) values differ significantly between MCI and non-MCI classes, for a level of significance, 0.05. Machine learning classifiers like, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Naive Bayes (NB) driven by mean NN intervals, RMS, SDNN and RMSSD, show a high accuracy of 80.80% on each individual feature input. Individuals with MCI are observed to have comparatively higher HR than healthy subjects. HR and its variability can be considered as potential biomarkers for detecting MCI.",

      "abstract": "In this work we perform a study of various unsupervised methods to identify mental stress in firefighter trainees based on unlabeled heart rate variability data. We collect RR interval time series data from nearly 100 firefighter trainees that participated in a drill. We explore and compare three methods in order to perform unsupervised stress detection: 1) traditional K-Means clustering with engineered time and frequency domain features 2) convolutional autoencoders and 3) long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders, both trained on the raw RRI measurements combined with DBSCAN clustering and K-Nearest-Neighbors classification. We demonstrate that K-Means combined with engineered features is unable to capture meaningful structure within the data. On the other hand, convolutional and LSTM autoencoders tend to extract varying structure from the data pointing to different clusters with different sizes of clusters. We attempt at identifying the true stressed and normal clusters using the HRV markers of mental stress reported in the literature. We demonstrate that the clusters produced by the convolutional autoencoders consistently and successfully stratify stressed versus normal samples, as validated by several established physiological stress markers such as RMSSD, Max-HR, Mean-HR and LF-HF ratio.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objective: The connection between depression and autonomous nervous system (ANS) is well documented in scientific literature. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a rich source of information for studying the dynamics of this relation. Disturbed heart dynamics in depression seriously increases mortality risk. Technical sciences help improve early detection and monitoring and offer more accurate management of treatment. Based on advances in computational power, information theory, complex systems dynamics, and nonlinear analysis applied to physiological complexity, we can now turn to novel biomarkers extracted from electrophysiological signals. This work is a cross-sectional analysis with methodological commentary of application of nonlinear measures of HRV related to depression. Methods: We systematically searched online for papers exploring the connection of depression and HRV, using both conventional and nonlinear analysis. We scrutinized chosen publications and methodologically analyzed and compared them. Results: Sixty-seven publications on the connection of HRV measures and depression meeting our inclusion criteria are selected. The effectiveness of the applied methods of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis are compared and discussed in the light of detection and prevention of depression-related cardiac diseases. Conclusions: It is clear that aberrated ANS dynamics can be detected via ECG analysis, where nonlinear measures show to be more sensitive and accurate than standard time and spectral ones. With the portable ECG devices and cloud-based telehealth applications, monitoring of outpatients could be done anytime anywhere. We appeal for early screening for cardiovascular abnormalities in depressive patients to prevent possible deleterious events.",

The influence of gyrosonics on autonomic nervous system of healthy subjects has been examined by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) in time- and frequency- domain. The M-lagged Poincare plot shows that the parameters SD1, SD2 and ratio SD12 (SD1/SD2) increases with lagged number M, and M-dependence is well described by Pade' approximant $\\chi \\frac{1+\\beta M}{1+\\gamma M}$ where values of $\\chi$, $\\beta$ and $ \\gamma$ depend on parameters SD1,SD2 and SD12. The values of these parameters for different M are augmented after gyrosonic stimulation. The slope and magnitude of curvature of SD1 and SD12 vs M plot increase considerably due to stimulation. The DFA analysis exhibits decrease in value of exponent $\\alpha$ due to stimulation. This stimulation results slower Heart rate, higher values of the standard deviation SD and the root-mean squared successive differences (RMSSD) in RR-interval. The spectral power of both low (LF) - and high (HF) - frequency go up due to the stimulation. The results suggest an improvement of the sympatho-vagal balance due to this novel audio stimulus.",

However, utilizing ECG for prolonged monitoring poses challenges as it necessitates connecting multiple electrodes to the patient's body. This can be discomforting and disruptive, hampering the attainment of uninterrupted recordings. Ballistocardiography (BCG) emerges as a promising substitute for ECG, presenting a non-invasive technique for recording the heart's mechanical activity. BCG signals can be captured using sensors positioned beneath the bed, thereby providing enhanced comfort and convenience for long-term monitoring of the subject. In a recent study, researchers compared the heart rate variability (HRV) indices derived from simultaneously acquired ECG and BCG signals. Encouragingly, the BCG signal yielded satisfactory results similar to those obtained from ECG, implying that BCG holds potential as a viable alternative for prolonged monitoring. The findings of this study carry substantial implications for the advancement of innovative, non-invasive methods in monitoring heart health. BCG showcases the ability to offer a more comfortable and convenient alternative to ECG while retaining its capacity to deliver accurate and reliable cardiac information concerning a patient's condition.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Heart rate variability (HRV) has been proven to be an important indicator of physiological status for numerous applications. Despite the progress and active developments made in HRV metric research over the last few decades, the representation of the heartbeat sequence upon which HRV is based has received relatively little attention. The recently introduced heart rate n-variability (HRnV) offers an alternative to R-to-R peak interval representations which complements conventional HRV analysis by considering HRV behavior on varying scales. Although HRnV has been shown to improve triage in pilot studies, there is currently no open and standard software to support future research of HRnV and its broader clinical applications. We aimed to develop an open, reliable, and easy to use software package implementing HRnV for further research and improvements of HRnV. This package has been designed to facilitate collaborative investigations between clinicians and researchers to study HRnV in various contexts and applications. Approach: We developed an open-source software, HRnV-Calc, based on the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox (PCST), which features comprehensive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for HRnV and HRV analysis. Main results: While preserving the core functionalities and performance of PCST, HRnV-Calc enables step-by-step manual inspection and configuration of HRV and HRnV analysis, so that results can be debugged, easily interpreted, and integrated to downstream applications. Significance: The open-source HRnV-Calc software, an accessible and standardized HRV and HRnV analysis platform, enhances the scope of HRV assessment and is designed to assist in future improvements and applications of HRnV and related research.",

      "abstract": "Signals from heart transplant recipients can be considered to be a natural source of information for a better understanding of the impact of the autonomic nervous system on the complexity of heart rate variability. Beat-to-beat heart rate variability can be represented as a network of increments between subsequent $RR$-intervals, which makes possible the visualization of short-term heart period fluctuations. A network is constructed of vertices representing increments between subsequent $RR$-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent $RR$-increments. Two modes of visualization of such a network are proposed. The method described is applied to nocturnal Holter signals recorded from healthy young people and from cardiac transplant recipients. Additionally, the analysis is performed on surrogate data: shuffled RR-intervals (to display short-range dependence), and shuffled phases of the Fourier Transform of RR-intervals (to filter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic nocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are associated with $RR$-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size greater than about 35 ms. They reveal that large accelerations are more likely antipersistent, while large decelerations are more likely persistent. Changes in $RR$-increments in a heart deprived of autonomic supervision are much lower than in a healthy individual, and appear to be maintained around a homeostatic state, but there are indications that this dynamics is nonlinear. The method is fruitful in the evaluation of the vagal activity - the quantity and quality of the vagal tone - during the nocturnal rest of healthy young people. The method also successfully extracts nonlinear effects related to intrinsic mechanisms of the heart regulation.",

Therefore, understanding human driver behaviour in these conditions will provide insight for future autonomous vehicles. For understanding driver behaviour, risk assessment is applied so far as one of the approaches by using both subjective and objective measurement. Subjective measurement methods such as questionnaires may provide insight into driver risk assessment but there is often significant variability between drivers.Physiological measurements such as heart rate (HR), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) provide more objective measurements of driver risk assessment. HR is often used for measuring driver risk assessment based on observed correlations between HR and risk perception. Previous work has used HR to measure driver risk assessment in self-driving systems, but pedestrian dynamics is not considered for the research. In this study, we observed driver behaviour in certain scenarios which have pedestrian on driving simulator. The scenarios have safe/unsafe situations (i.e., pedestrian crosses road and vehicle may hit pedestrian in one scenario), HR analysis in time/frequency domain is processed for risk assessment. As a result, HR analysis in frequency domain shows certain reasonability for driver risk assessment when driver has pedestrian in its traffic.",

While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.   Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.   Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.   Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.",

We investigated cross-correlation between RR and QT intervals in long-term ECG recordings from 202 healthy subjects using time-lagged cross-correlation analysis to explore how QT intervals correlate with both preceding and succeeding RR intervals across various time lags. Data was preprocessed with the smoothness priors method to remove long-term trends while preserving relevant short-term dynamics.   Our results reveal that, as expected, the highest RR-QT cross-correlations occur when the intervals overlap the most. Notably, we also observed a strong cross-correlation between the present QT interval and the preceding RR interval, with the overall correlations skewed toward negative lags. This suggests that past RR intervals exert a stronger influence on current QT intervals. These findings align with previous research on RR-QT transfer entropy.   We found no significant differences in RR-QT cross-correlations between sexes. However, aging was associated with significantly reduced cross-correlations across all lags. This effect is consistent with existing literature on age-related cardiac changes and provides further insight into the impact of aging on RR-QT coupling. Additionally, we observed a slight positive correlation between heart rate and cross-correlation at all lags, with cross-correlation decreasing as the lag increased. These findings enhance our understanding of the dynamic RR-QT relationship and may inform future studies on cardiac electrophysiology and diseases.",

Lagged Poincare plot of the heart rate(HR), the method of the principal component analysis, and the autocorrelation of HR fluctuations are used to analyze the HR. The variation of Poincare parameters (SD1),(SD2) and their ratio (SD12), with a lagged number, are non-linear and reveal a significant change with meditation. In particular, the magnitude of the slope and the curvature of(SD12) with lagged number increases after meditation. The meditation reduces the heart rate and increases the stroke volume. A strong correlation between slope and curvature of (SD12) is noted from the correlation matrix of multi-dimensional data set resulting from the Poincar\\'e plot. The principal components (PC) of data resulting from pre-and post-meditation are well separated in PC-space. The entropy associated with R-wave fluctuations for all meditators is reduced after meditation. The auto-correlation of HR fluctuations exhibits a highly correlated pattern after meditation.

In particular, we introduce dynamical detrended fluctuation analysis and dynamical partial autocorrelation functions, which are able to detect real-time changes in the scaling and correlations of the RRIs as functions of the scale and the lag. We relate these changes to the exercise intensity quantified by the heart rate (HR). Beyond subject-specific HR thresholds the RRIs show multiscale anticorrelations with both universal and individual scale-dependent structure that is potentially affected by the stride frequency. These preliminary results are encouraging for future applications of the dynamical statistical analysis in exercise physiology and cardiology, and the presented methodology is also applicable across various disciplines.",

      "abstract": "One of the most promising non-invasive markers of the activity of the autonomic nervous system is Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV analysis toolkits often provide spectral analysis techniques using the Fourier transform, which assumes that the heart rate series is stationary. To overcome this issue, the Short Time Fourier Transform is often used (STFT). However, the wavelet transform is thought to be a more suitable tool for analyzing non-stationary signals than the STFT. Given the lack of support for wavelet-based analysis in HRV toolkits, such analysis must be implemented by the researcher. This has made this technique underutilized. This paper presents a new algorithm to perform HRV power spectrum analysis based on the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (MODWPT). The algorithm calculates the power in any spectral band with a given tolerance for the band's boundaries. The MODWPT decomposition tree is pruned to avoid calculating unnecessary wavelet coefficients, thereby optimizing execution time. The center of energy shift correction is applied to achieve optimum alignment of the wavelet coefficients. This algorithm has been implemented in RHRV, an open-source package for HRV analysis. To the best of our knowledge, RHRV is the first HRV toolkit with support for wavelet-based spectral analysis.",

      "abstract": "This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception.   Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.",

While control systems can be vulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating consequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems. American Gas Association (AGA), IEC TC57 WG15, IEEE, NIST and National SCADA Test Bed Program have been actively designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the report AGA 12 part 1. The AGA 12 part 2 has been transferred to IEEE P1711. This paper presents an attack on the protocols in the first draft of AGA standard (Wright et al., 2004). This attack shows that the security mechanisms in the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We then propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems which include: point-to-point secure channels, authenticated broadcast channels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency channels. These protocols are designed to address the specific challenges that SCADA systems have.",

Power system operations are conducted through communication systems that are mapped to standards, protocols, ports, and addresses. Real-time situational awareness is a standard term with implications and applications in both power systems and cybersecurity. In the plausible quantum world (Q-world), conventional approaches will likely face new challenges. The unique art of transmitting a quantum state from one place, Alice, to another, Bob, is known as quantum communication. Quantum communication for SCADA communication in a plausible quantum era thus obviously entails wired communication through optical fiber networks complying with the typical cybersecurity criteria of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for classical internet technology unless a quantum internet (qinternet) transpires practically. When combined with the reverse order of AIC for operational technology, the cybersecurity criteria for power networks' critical infrastructure drill down to more specific sub-areas. Unlike other communication modes, such as information technology (IT) in broadband internet connections, SCADA for power networks, one of the critical infrastructures, is intricately intertwined with operations technology (OT), which significantly increases complexity. Though it is desirable to have a barrier called a demilitarized zone (DMZ), some overlap is inevitable. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges in securing SCADA communication in the plausible quantum computing and communication regime, along with a corresponding integrated Qiskit implementation for possible future framework development.",

The results from studies into previous global attacks involving SCADA and CI, with focus on two highly serious incidents in Iran and Ukraine, reveal that although interconnectivity is a major factor, isolated CIs are still highly vulnerable to attack due to risks within the SCADA controllers and protocols.",

Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used in industrial, infrastructure and facility processes (e.g. manufacturing, fabrication, oil and water pipelines, building ventilation, etc.) Like other Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, SCADA systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, therefore, a robust anomaly detection is a major requirement. However, having an accurate anomaly detection system is not an easy task, due to the difficulty to differentiate between cyber-attacks and system internal failures (e.g. hardware failures). In this paper, we present a model that detects anomaly events in a water system controlled by SCADA. Six Machine Learning techniques have been used in building and evaluating the model. The model classifies different anomaly events including hardware failures (e.g. sensor failures), sabotage and cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS and Spoofing). Unlike other detection systems, our proposed work focuses on notifying the operator when an anomaly occurs with a probability of the event occurring. This additional information helps in accelerating the mitigation process. The model is trained and tested using a real-world dataset.",

Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments.",

Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the \"security by obscurity\" principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition while the most common ones are related to weak boundary protection. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding these reports. This paper bridges this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents.

However, as these vehicles become more connected, cybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern. Protecting the security and integrity of autonomous systems is essential to prevent malicious activities that can harm passengers, other road users, and the overall transportation network. This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity issues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved, which are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles depend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external infrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber threats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious problems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very important to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the growth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major cybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks from wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also reviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion detection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry collaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment for autonomous vehicles. Setting clear rules and best practices is necessary for consistent protection across manufacturers and regions. By analyzing the current cybersecurity landscape and suggesting practical countermeasures, this paper aims to contribute to the safe development and public trust of autonomous vehicle technology.",

Results show that MinTWin SVM minimizes false positives and is responsive to physical process anomalies.

This, in turn, makes it challenging to endow them with fool-proof security solutions. In this paper, a unified model for interdependent gas-power-water infrastructure is presented and the security of this model is studied using a novel game-theoretic framework. In particular, a zero-sum noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation is 35\\% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the interdependent system to protect the grid from state deviations.",

Approaches used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between specificity and generality of application in sectors.",

The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.",

However, these critical cyber systems are generally governed by multiple jurisdictions, for instance the Metro in the Washington, D.C. area is managed by the states of Virginia and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia (DC) through Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Additionally, the water treatment infrastructure managed by DC Water consists of waste water input from Fairfax and Arlington counties, and the district (i.e. DC). Additionally, cyber attacks usually launch from unknown sources, through unknown switches and servers, and end up at the destination without much knowledge on their source or path. Certain infrastructures are shared amongst multiple countries, another idiosyncrasy that exacerbates the issue of governance. This law paper however, is not concerned with the general governance of these infrastructures, rather with the ambiguity in the relevant laws or doctrines about which authority would prevail in the context of a cyber threat or a cyber-attack, with a focus on federal vs. state issues, international law involvement, federal preemption, technical aspects that could affect lawmaking, and conflicting responsibilities in cases of cyber crime. A legal analysis of previous cases is presented, as well as an extended discussion addressing different sides of the argument.",

In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology released the final version of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithm standards in August 2024. These post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are primarily based on lattice-based and hash-based cryptography. Therefore, this study proposes the Post-Quantum Cryptography Winternitz-Chen (PQCWC) anonymous scheme, aimed at exploring the design of anonymous schemes based on PQC for future applications in privacy protection. The anonymous scheme designed in this study is mainly built on the Winternitz signature scheme, which can prevent the original public key from being exposed in the certificate. Furthermore, the PQCWC anonymous scheme integrates the butterfly key expansion mechanism, proposing the first hash-based butterfly key expansion mechanism in the world, achieving anonymity for both the registration authority and the certificate authority, thereby fully protecting privacy. In the experimental environment, this study compares various hash algorithms, including Secure Hash Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), the SHA-2 series, the SHA-3 series, and the BLAKE series. The results demonstrate that the proposed anonymous scheme can achieve anonymity without increasing key length, signature length, key generation time, signature generation time, or signature verification time.",

      "abstract": "Forward-secure signatures guarantee that the signatures generated before the compromise of private key remain secure, and therefore offer an enhanced compromise-resiliency for real-life applications such as digital forensics, audit logs, and financial systems. However, the vast majority of state-of-the-art forward-secure signatures rely on conventional intractability assumptions and therefore are not secure against quantum computers. Hash-based signatures (HBS) (e.g., XMSS) can offer forward-secure post-quantum security. However, they are efficient only for a pre-defined number of messages to be signed and incur high key generation overhead, highly expensive signing, and large signature sizes for an increasing number of messages. It is an open problem to develop quantum-safe forward-secure signatures that are efficient and practical with a signing capability scalable to their security parameters.   In this work, we propose a new series of post-quantum signatures that we call FROG (Forward-secuRe pOst-quantum siGnature). Unlike HBS alternatives, FROG can achieve highly computational efficient signatures with sub-linear key/signature sizes and (practically) unbounded signing capability. This is achieved by transforming suitable post-quantum signatures into forward-secure settings via MMM constructions. We investigated the transformation of prominent post-quantum secure signatures such as Dilithium, WOTS, and BLISS with MMM. Our experiments indicate that FROG outperforms XMSS for the vast majority (if not all for a large number of messages) of performance metrics. We also discuss one-time variants of these base signature schemes that can push the performance of FROG to the edge. Overall, FROG shows a better performance than the existing alternatives with forward-security and therefore is an ideal alternative for the standardization efforts for forward-secure post-quantum signatures.",

For (ordinary) signatures, we focus on the arguably preferable security notion of blind-unforgeability recently proposed by Alagic et al. (Eurocrypt'20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with super-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable schemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature, and both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.   For ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21) proposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the signer. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the classical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring signatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves (even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only conduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose a new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is an analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover, assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any blind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our definition.",

Then, we point out, in this scheme and the prior schemes, there exists a problem that Bob can repudiate the integrality of the signatures. To conquer this problem, we construct another arbitrated quantum signature scheme without using quantum entangled states but using a public board. The new scheme has three advantages: it does not utilize entangled states while it can preserve all merits in the existing schemes; the integrality of the signature can avoid being disavowed by the receiver; and, it provides a higher efficiency in transmission and reduces the complexity of implementation.

First, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signing keys from the LWE assumption. In this primitive, the signing key is a quantum state which enables a user to sign many messages and yet, the quantum key is also revocable, i.e., it can be collapsed into a classical certificate which can later be verified. Once the key is successfully revoked, we require that the initial recipient of the key loses the ability to sign. We construct digital signatures with revocable signing keys from a newly introduced primitive which we call two-tier one-shot signatures, which may be of independent interest. This is a variant of one-shot signatures, where the verification of a signature for the message ``0'' is done publicly, whereas the verification for the message ``1'' is done in private. We give a construction of two-tier one-shot signatures from the LWE assumption. As a complementary result, we also construct digital signatures with quantum revocation from group actions, where the quantum signing key is simply ``returned'' and then verified as part of revocation.   Second, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signatures from OWFs. In this primitive, the signer can produce quantum signatures which can later be revoked. Here, the security property requires that, once revocation is successful, the initial recipient of the signature loses the ability to find accepting inputs to the signature verification algorithm. We construct this primitive using a newly introduced two-tier variant of tokenized signatures. For the construction, we show a new lemma which we call the adaptive hardcore bit property for OWFs, which may enable further applications.",

This property relies on the fact that a successful forgery of a hash-based signature most likely results in a collision with respect to the employed hash function, while the demonstration of this collision could serve as convincing evidence of the forgery. Here we prove that with properly adjusted parameters Lamport and Winternitz one-time signatures schemes could exhibit a forgery detection availability property. This property is of significant importance in the framework of crypto-agility paradigm since the considered forgery detection serves as an alarm that the employed cryptographic hash function becomes insecure to use and the corresponding scheme has to be replaced.",

This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized method leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program input. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, compared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz signatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a modification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, (2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new enhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a fraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for proving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX protocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV proofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed (IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future deployment of PQC systems.",

We present an energy requirement analysis based on extensive measurements of PQC candidate algorithms on a Cortex M4 - based reference platform. We relate computational (energy) costs of PQC algorithms to their data transmission costs which are expected to increase with new types of public keys and ciphertext messages. The energy, bandwidth, and latency needs of PQC algorithms span several orders of magnitude, which is substantial enough to impact battery life, user experience, and application protocol design. We propose metrics and guidelines for PQC algorithm usage in IoT and mobile systems based on our findings. Our evidence supports the view that fast structured-lattice PQC schemes are the preferred choice for cloud-connected mobile devices in most use cases, even when per-bit data transmission energy cost is relatively high.",

Hence, a community effort exists to develop post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, i.e., algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks. In this work, we have investigated how lattice-based candidate algorithms from the NIST PQC standardization competition fare when conceived as hardware accelerators. To achieve this, we have assessed the reference implementations of selected algorithms with the goal of identifying what are their basic building blocks. We assume the hardware accelerators will be implemented in application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and the targeted technology in our experiments is a commercial 65nm node. In order to estimate the characteristics of each algorithm, we have assessed their memory requirements, use of multipliers, and how each algorithm employs hashing functions. Furthermore, for these building blocks, we have collected area and power figures for 12 candidate algorithms. For memories, we make use of a commercial memory compiler. For logic, we make use of a standard cell library. In order to compare the candidate algorithms fairly, we select a reference frequency of operation of 500MHz. Our results reveal that our area and power numbers are comparable to the state of the art, despite targeting a higher frequency of operation and a higher security level in our experiments. The comprehensive investigation of lattice-based NIST PQC algorithms performed in this paper can be used for guiding ASIC designers when selecting an appropriate algorithm while respecting requirements and design constraints.",

Therefore, the V2X SCMS is threatened by quantum computing attacks. However, although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already selected Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms as the standard, the current PQC algorithms may have issues such as longer public key lengths, longer signature lengths, or lower signature generation and verification efficiency, which may not fully meet the requirements of V2X communication applications. In view of the challenges in V2X communication, such as packet length, signature generation and verification efficiency, security level, and vehicle privacy, this study proposes a hybrid certificate scheme of PQC and ECC. By leveraging the strengths of both PQC and ECC, this scheme aims to overcome the challenges in V2X communication. PQC is used to establish a security level resistant to quantum computing attacks, while ECC is utilized to establish anonymous certificates and reduce packet length to meet the requirements of V2X communication. In the practical experiments, the study implemented the SCMS end entity based on the Chunghwa Telecom SCMS and the Clientron On-Board Unit (OBU) to conduct field tests in Danhai New Town in New Taipei City. The performance of various existing hybrid certificate schemes combining PQC (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+) and ECC is compared, and a practical solution is provided for V2X industries.",

      "abstract": "With the constantly advancing capabilities of quantum computers, conventional cryptographic systems relying on complex math problems may encounter unforeseen vulnerabilities. Unlike regular computers, which are often deemed cost-ineffective in cryptographic attacks, quantum computers have a significant advantage in calculation speed. This distinction potentially makes currently used algorithms less secure or even completely vulnerable, compelling the exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as the most reasonable solution to quantum threats. This review aims to provide current information on applications, benefits, and challenges associated with the PQC. The review employs a systematic scoping review with the scope restricted to the years 2022 and 2023; only articles that were published in scientific journals were used in this paper. The review examined the articles on the applications of quantum computing in various spheres. However, the scope of this paper was restricted to the domain of the PQC because most of the analyzed articles featured this field. Subsequently, the paper is analyzing various PQC algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial, and isogeny-based cryptography. Each algorithm is being judged based on its potential applications, robustness, and challenges. All the analyzed algorithms are promising for the post-quantum era in such applications as digital signatures, communication channels, and IoT. Moreover, some of the algorithms are already implemented in the spheres of banking transactions, communication, and intellectual property. Meanwhile, despite their potential, these algorithms face serious challenges since they lack standardization, require vast amounts of storage and computation power, and might have unknown vulnerabilities that can be discovered only with years of cryptanalysis.",

      "abstract": "The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community.   On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of \"cryptographic agility\".",

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has initiated a standardization process for PQC algorithms, and several candidates, including CRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, have reached the final stages. This paper first provides a comprehensive analysis of the hardware complexity of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in embedded systems, categorizing PQC algorithms into families based on their underlying mathematical problems: lattice-based, code-based, hash-based and multivariate / isogeny-based schemes. Each family presents distinct computational, memory, and energy profiles, making them suitable for different use cases. To address these challenges, this paper discusses optimization strategies such as pipelining, parallelization, and high-level synthesis (HLS), which can improve the performance and energy efficiency of PQC implementations. Finally, a detailed complexity analysis of CRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, comparing their key generation, encryption, and decryption processes in terms of computational complexity, has been conducted.",

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has selected CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium as standardized PQC algorithms for secure key exchange and digital signatures, respectively. This study conducts a comprehensive performance analysis of these algorithms by benchmarking execution times across cryptographic operations such as key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. Additionally, the impact of AVX2 optimizations is evaluated to assess hardware acceleration benefits. Our findings demonstrate that Kyber and Dilithium achieve efficient execution times, outperforming classical cryptographic schemes such as RSA and ECDSA at equivalent security levels. Beyond technical performance, the real-world deployment of PQC introduces challenges in telecommunications networks, where large-scale infrastructure upgrades, interoperability with legacy systems, and regulatory constraints must be addressed. This paper examines the feasibility of PQC adoption in telecom environments, highlighting key transition challenges, security risks, and implementation strategies. Through industry case studies, we illustrate how telecom operators are integrating PQC into 5G authentication, subscriber identity protection, and secure communications. Our analysis provides insights into the computational trade-offs, deployment considerations, and standardization efforts shaping the future of quantum-safe cryptographic infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of quantum computers threatens traditional cryptographic schemes, prompting the need for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Although the NIST standardization process has accelerated the development of such algorithms, their application in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems remains a challenge. Automotive systems relying on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus for communication are particularly vulnerable due to their limited computational capabilities, high traffic, and need for real-time response. These constraints raise concerns about the feasibility of implementing PQC in automotive environments, where legacy hardware and bit rate limitations must also be considered.   In this paper, we introduce PQ-CAN, a modular framework for simulating the performance and overhead of PQC algorithms in embedded systems. We consider the automotive domain as our case study, testing a variety of PQC schemes under different scenarios. Our simulation enables the adjustment of embedded system computational capabilities and CAN bus bit rate constraints. We also provide insights into the trade-offs involved by analyzing each algorithm's security level and overhead for key encapsulation and digital signature. By evaluating the performance of these algorithms, we provide insights into their feasibility and identify the strengths and limitations of PQC in securing automotive communications in the post-quantum era.",

      "abstract": "The trajectory of an individual's recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is heterogeneous, with complete recovery in some cases but persistent disability in others. We hypothesized that changes in structural brain network abnormalities guide the trajectory of an individual's recovery post-injury. Our objective was to characterize the variability in recovery post-TBI by identifying a putative neuroimaging biomarker of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in individuals with mild TBI.   We analyzed 70 T1-weighted and diffusion MRIs longitudinally collected from 35 individuals during the subacute and chronic post-injury periods. Each individual underwent longitudinal blood work to characterize blood protein biomarkers of axonal and glial injury and assessment of post-injury recovery in the subacute and chronic periods. By comparing the MRI data of individual cases with 35 controls, we estimated the longitudinal change in structural brain network abnormalities. We validated this proxy measure of TAI with independent measures of acute intracranial injury estimated from head CT and blood protein biomarkers.   Post-injury structural network abnormality was significantly higher than controls in both subacute and chronic periods, associated with an acute CT lesion and subacute blood levels of glial fibrillary acid protein (r=0.5, p=0.008) and neurofilament light (r=0.41, p=0.02). Longitudinal change in abnormality associated with change in functional outcome status (r=-0.51, p=0.003) and post-concussive symptoms (BSI: r=0.46, p=0.03; RPQ:r = 0.46, p=0.02). Brain regions that most closely mapped onto symptom change over time corresponded to structural network hubs or areas susceptible to neurotrauma.   Structural network abnormalities might be a biomarker of TAI. Assessing changes in brain network abnormality might enable better patient stratification for monitoring recovery after neurotrauma.",

This paper proposes a new coupled loading-rate hypothesis for the traumatic brain injury (TBI), which states that the main cause of the TBI is an external Euclidean jolt, or SE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that strikes the head in several coupled degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. To show this, based on the previously defined covariant force law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler dynamics of brain's micro-motions within the cerebrospinal fluid and derive from it the coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is a cause of the TBI in two forms of brain's rapid discontinuous deformations: translational dislocations and rotational disclinations. Brain's dislocations and disclinations, caused by the SE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum brain model.

A comprehensive set of sensitive, robust and non-invasive measurements is therefore essential in assessing variations in speech characteristics over time following pediatric TBI. In this article, we study the changes in the acoustic speech patterns of a pediatric cohort of ten subjects diagnosed with severe TBI. We extract a diverse set of both well-known and novel acoustic features from child speech recorded throughout the year after the child produced intelligible words. These features are analyzed individually and by speech subsystem, within-subject and across the cohort. As a group, older children exhibit highly significant (p<0.01) increases in pitch variation and phoneme diversity, shortened pause length, and steadying articulation rate variability. Younger children exhibit similar steadied rate variability alongside an increase in formant-based articulation complexity. Correlation analysis of the feature set with age and comparisons to normative developmental data confirm that age at injury plays a significant role in framing the recovery trajectory. Nearly all speech features significantly change (p<0.05) for the cohort as a whole, confirming that acoustic measures supplementing perceptual assessment are needed to identify efficacious treatment targets for speech therapy following TBI.",

While many studies have delved into TBI phenotyping for distinct patient populations, identifying TBI phenotypes that consistently generalize across various settings and populations remains a critical research gap. Our research addresses this by employing multivariate time-series clustering to unveil TBI's dynamic intricates. Utilizing a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-Series data with missing values (SLAC-Time), we analyzed both the research-centric TRACK-TBI and the real-world MIMIC-IV datasets. Remarkably, the optimal hyperparameters of SLAC-Time and the ideal number of clusters remained consistent across these datasets, underscoring SLAC-Time's stability across heterogeneous datasets. Our analysis revealed three generalizable TBI phenotypes ({\\alpha}, \\b{eta}, and {\\gamma}), each exhibiting distinct non-temporal features during emergency department visits, and temporal feature profiles throughout ICU stays. Specifically, phenotype {\\alpha} represents mild TBI with a remarkably consistent clinical presentation. In contrast, phenotype \\b{eta} signifies severe TBI with diverse clinical manifestations, and phenotype {\\gamma} represents a moderate TBI profile in terms of severity and clinical diversity. Age is a significant determinant of TBI outcomes, with older cohorts recording higher mortality rates. Importantly, while certain features varied by age, the core characteristics of TBI manifestations tied to each phenotype remain consistent across diverse populations.",

A random parameters multinomial logit model with heterogeneity in the means was utilized to assess patients outcomes in three categories: Non-surgical, Surgical, and Fatal. From the random parameters, the study found that male patients (55.48%) are more likely to experience surgical and fatal outcomes. Male motorcycle users have a higher probability of experiencing fatal consequences. Additionally, 60.94% of incidents on rural roads result in surgeries and fatalities, with nighttime crashes on these roads significantly increasing the likelihood of fatal outcomes. Key factors impacting the likelihood of TBIs outcomes include older age, pedestrian involvement, bus and truck crashes, speeding, wet pavements, overtaking, low visibility, and weekday crashes. The study identified two significant interaction variables that increase the probability of fatal outcomes from TBIs: the interactions between low visibility and bus involvement, and between overtaking and wet pavements. While these factors individually had a higher probability of leading to both surgical and fatal outcomes, together these factors increase the risks to fatalities. Overall, our findings provide more detailed insights about the impact of TBIs outcomes resulting from RTCs and emphasize the need to develop more effective measures to improve road safety and patient outcomes.",

We investigated the pathophysiology evolution within the first three hours after closed-head traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), two common traumatic vascular injuries, in mice. We took a multi-modal imaging approach using photoacoustic, color Doppler, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mice. Brain oxygenation (%sO2) and velocity-weighted volume of blood flow (VVF) values significantly decreased from baseline to fifteen minutes after both TBI and SAH. TBI resulted in 19.2% and 41.0% ipsilateral %sO2 and VVF reductions 15 minutes post injury while SAH resulted in 43.9% %sO2 and 85.0% VVF reduction ipsilaterally (p<0.001). We found partial recovery of %sO2 from 15 minutes to 3-hours after injury for TBI but not SAH. Hemorrhage, edema, reduced perfusion, and altered diffusivity were evident from MRI scans acquired 90-150 minutes after injury in both models although the spatial distribution was mostly focal for TBI and diffuse for SAH. The results reveal that the cerebral %sO2 deficits immediately following injuries are reversible for TBI and irreversible for SAH. Our findings can inform future studies on mitigating these early responses to improve long-term recovery.",

This is due in part to the heterogeneity of damage inflicted to the brain, ultimately resulting in diverse and complex outcomes. Using a data-driven approach on many distinct data elements may be necessary to describe this large set of outcomes and thereby robustly depict the nuanced differences among TBI patients' recovery. In this work, we develop a method for modeling large heterogeneous data types relevant to TBI. Our approach is geared toward the probabilistic representation of mixed continuous and discrete variables with missing values. The model is trained on a dataset encompassing a variety of data types, including demographics, blood-based biomarkers, and imaging findings. In addition, it includes a set of clinical outcome assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. The model is used to stratify patients into distinct groups in an unsupervised learning setting. We use the model to infer outcomes using input data, and show that the collection of input data reduces uncertainty of outcomes over a baseline approach. In addition, we quantify the performance of a likelihood scoring technique that can be used to self-evaluate the extrapolation risk of prognosis on unseen patients.",

      "abstract": "The accurate prognosis for traumatic brain injury (TBI) patients is difficult yet essential to inform therapy, patient management, and long-term after-care. Patient characteristics such as age, motor and pupil responsiveness, hypoxia and hypotension, and radiological findings on computed tomography (CT), have been identified as important variables for TBI outcome prediction. CT is the acute imaging modality of choice in clinical practice because of its acquisition speed and widespread availability. However, this modality is mainly used for qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment, such as the Marshall scoring system, which is prone to subjectivity and human errors. This work explores the predictive power of imaging biomarkers extracted from routinely-acquired hospital admission CT scans using a state-of-the-art, deep learning TBI lesion segmentation method. We use lesion volumes and corresponding lesion statistics as inputs for an extended TBI outcome prediction model. We compare the predictive power of our proposed features to the Marshall score, independently and when paired with classic TBI biomarkers. We find that automatically extracted quantitative CT features perform similarly or better than the Marshall score in predicting unfavourable TBI outcomes. Leveraging automatic atlas alignment, we also identify frontal extra-axial lesions as important indicators of poor outcome. Our work may contribute to a better understanding of TBI, and provides new insights into how automated neuroimaging analysis can be used to improve prognostication after TBI.",

Estimation of this relationship requires clinical information on injury severity, patient demographics, and healthcare utilization, which are often obtained from separate data sources. Because of privacy and confidentiality regulations, these data sources do not include unique identifiers to link records across data sources. Record linkage is a process to identify records that represent the same entity across data sources in the absence of unique identifiers. These processes commonly rely on agreement between variables that appear in both data sources to link records. However, when the number of records in each file is large, this task is computationally intensive and may result in false links. Blocking is a data partitioning technique that reduces the number of possible links that should be considered. Healthcare providers can be used as blocks in applications of record linkage with healthcare datasets. However, providers may not be uniquely identified across files. We propose a Bayesian record linkage procedure that simultaneously performs block-level and record-level linkage. This iterative approach incorporates the record-level linkage within block pairs to improve the accuracy of the block-level linkage. Subsequently, the algorithm improves record-level linkage using the accurate partitioning of the linkage space through blocking. We demonstrate that our proposed method provides improved performance compared to existing Bayesian record linkage methods that do not incorporate blocking. The proposed procedure is then used to merge registry data from the National Trauma Data Bank with Medicare claims data to estimate the relationship between injury severity and TBI patients' recovery.",

TBI outcomes are commonly categorised by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) into 8, ordered levels of functional recovery at 6 months after injury. Existing ICU prognostic models predict binary outcomes at a certain threshold of GOSE (e.g., prediction of survival [GOSE>1] or functional independence [GOSE>4]). We aimed to develop ordinal prediction models that concurrently predict probabilities of each GOSE score. From a prospective cohort (n=1,550, 65 centres) in the ICU stratum of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) patient dataset, we extracted all clinical information within 24 hours of ICU admission (1,151 predictors) and 6-month GOSE scores. We analysed the effect of 2 design elements on ordinal model performance: (1) the baseline predictor set, ranging from a concise set of 10 validated predictors to a token-embedded representation of all possible predictors, and (2) the modelling strategy, from ordinal logistic regression to multinomial deep learning. With repeated k-fold cross-validation, we found that expanding the baseline predictor set significantly improved ordinal prediction performance while increasing analytical complexity did not. Half of these gains could be achieved with the addition of 8 high-impact predictors (2 demographic variables, 4 protein biomarkers, and 2 severity assessments) to the concise set. At best, ordinal models achieved 0.76 (95% CI: 0.74-0.77) ordinal discrimination ability (ordinal c-index) and 57% (95% CI: 54%-60%) explanation of ordinal variation in 6-month GOSE (Somers' D). Our results motivate the search for informative predictors for higher GOSE and the development of ordinal dynamic prediction models.",

Blast pressure waves can cause TBI without penetrating wounds or blunt force trauma. Similarly, bullet impacts distant from the brain can produce pressure waves sufficient to cause mild to moderate TBI. The fluid percussion model of TBI shows that pressure impulses of 15-30 psi cause mild to moderate TBI in laboratory animals. In pigs and dogs, bullet impacts to the thigh produce pressure waves in the brain of 18-45 psi and measurable injury to neurons and neuroglia. Analyses of research in goats and epidemiological data from shooting events involving humans show high correlations (r > 0.9) between rapid incapacitation and pressure wave magnitude in the thoracic cavity. A case study has documented epilepsy resulting from a pressure wave without the bullet directly hitting the brain. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that bullet impacts distant from the brain produce pressure waves that travel to the brain and can retain sufficient magnitude to induce brain injury. The link to long-term sequelae could be investigated via epidemiological studies of patients who were gunshot in the chest to determine whether they experience elevated rates of epilepsy and other neurological sequelae.",

Biomarkers that map onto the underlying brain pathology driving these complications are urgently needed to identify individuals at risk for poor recovery and to inform design of clinical trials of neuroprotective therapies. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are two endophenotypes associated with increases in brain extracellular water content after trauma. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between a neuroimaging biomarker of extracellular free water content and the clinical features of patients with traumatic brain injury. We analyzed a cohort of 64 adult patients requiring hospitalization for non-penetrating traumatic brain injury of all severities as well as 32 healthy controls. Patients underwent brain MRI and clinical neuropsychological assessment in the subacute (2-weeks) and chronic (6-months) post-injury period, and controls underwent a single MRI. For each subject, we derived a summary score representing deviations in whole brain white matter (1) extracellular free water volume fraction (VF) and (2) free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (fw-FA). The summary specific anomaly score (SAS) for VF was significantly higher in TBI patients in the subacute and chronic post-injury period relative to controls. SAS for VF significantly correlated with neuropsychological functioning in the subacute, but not chronic post-injury period. These findings indicate abnormalities in whole brain white matter extracellular water fraction in patients with TBI and are an important step toward identifying and validating noninvasive biomarkers that map onto the pathology driving disability after TBI.",

To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.",

According to an analysis of the laws and associated policy documents, (i) cyber security crises are equated in the EU to large-scale cyber security incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states. For this and other purposes, (ii) the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including but not limited to the large-scale incidents. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, however, (iii) the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the EU-level.

However, the use of ML and AI in digital forensics is still in its nascent stages. As a result, this paper gives a thorough and in-depth analysis that goes beyond a simple survey and review. The goal is to look closely at how AI and ML techniques are used in digital forensics and incident response. This research explores cutting-edge research initiatives that cross domains such as data collection and recovery, the intricate reconstruction of cybercrime timelines, robust big data analysis, pattern recognition, safeguarding the chain of custody, and orchestrating responsive strategies to hacking incidents. This endeavour digs far beneath the surface to unearth the intricate ways AI-driven methodologies are shaping these crucial facets of digital forensics practice. While the promise of AI in digital forensics is evident, the challenges arising from increasing database sizes and evolving criminal tactics necessitate ongoing collaborative research and refinement within the digital forensics profession. This study examines the contributions, limitations, and gaps in the existing research, shedding light on the potential and limitations of AI and ML techniques. By exploring these different research areas, we highlight the critical need for strategic planning, continual research, and development to unlock AI's full potential in digital forensics and incident response. Ultimately, this paper underscores the significance of AI and ML integration in digital forensics, offering insights into their benefits, drawbacks, and broader implications for tackling modern cyber threats.",

      "abstract": "A major cyber security incident can represent a cyber crisis for an organisation, in particular because of the associated risk of substantial reputational damage. As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach. It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective corporate communication after cyber security incidents.",

      "abstract": "The escalating sophistication and volume of cyber threats in cloud environments necessitate a paradigm shift in strategies. Recognising the need for an automated and precise response to cyber threats, this research explores the application of AI and ML and proposes an AI-powered cyber incident response system for cloud environments. This system, encompassing Network Traffic Classification, Web Intrusion Detection, and post-incident Malware Analysis (built as a Flask application), achieves seamless integration across platforms like Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. The findings from this research highlight the effectiveness of the Random Forest model, achieving an accuracy of 90% for the Network Traffic Classifier and 96% for the Malware Analysis Dual Model application. Our research highlights the strengths of AI-powered cyber security. The Random Forest model excels at classifying cyber threats, offering an efficient and robust solution. Deep learning models significantly improve accuracy, and their resource demands can be managed using cloud-based TPUs and GPUs. Cloud environments themselves provide a perfect platform for hosting these AI/ML systems, while container technology ensures both efficiency and scalability. These findings demonstrate the contribution of the AI-led system in guaranteeing a robust and scalable cyber incident response solution in the cloud.",

      "abstract": "This Research proposes a Novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimise malware forensics investigation during cyber incident response. It aims to improve forensic investigation efficiency by reducing false negatives and adapting current practices to evolving malware signatures. The proposed RL framework leverages techniques such as Q-learning and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to train the system to identify malware patterns in live memory dumps, thereby automating forensic tasks. The RL model is based on a detailed malware workflow diagram that guides the analysis of malware artefacts using static and behavioural techniques as well as machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it seeks to address challenges in the UK justice system by ensuring the accuracy of forensic evidence. We conduct testing and evaluation in controlled environments, using datasets created with Windows operating systems to simulate malware infections. The experimental results demonstrate that RL improves malware detection rates compared to conventional methods, with the RL model's performance varying depending on the complexity and learning rate of the environment. The study concludes that while RL offers promising potential for automating malware forensics, its efficacy across diverse malware types requires ongoing refinement of reward systems and feature extraction methods.",

      "abstract": "Data breaches refer to unauthorized accesses to data. Typically but not always, data breaches are about cyber crime. An organization facing such a crime is often also in a crisis situation. Therefore, organizations should prepare also for data breaches in their crisis management procedures. These procedures should include also crisis communication plans. To this end, this paper examines data breach crisis communication strategies and their practical executions. The background comes from the vibrant crisis communication research domain. According to a few qualitative case studies from Finland, the conventional wisdom holds well; the successful cases indicate communicating early, taking responsibility, offering an apology, and notifying public authorities. The unsuccessful cases show varying degrees of the reverse, including shifting of blame, positioning of an organization as a victim, and failing to notify public authorities. With these qualitative insights, the paper contributes to the research domain by focusing specifically on data breach crises, their peculiarities, and their management, including with respect to European regulations that have been neglected in existing crisis communication research.",

      "abstract": "Crisis management (CM) for critical infrastructures, natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, terrorist actions, or civil unrest requires high speed communications and connectivity, and access to high performance computational resources to deliver timely dynamic responses to the crisis being managed by different first responders. CM systems should detect, recognize, and disseminate huge amounts of heterogeneous dynamic events that operate at different speeds and formats. Furthermore, the processing of crisis events and the development of real-time responses are major research challenges when the communications and computational resources needed by CM stakeholders are not available or severely degraded by the crisis. The main goal of the research presented in this paper is to utilize Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) to provide Aerial-based Crisis Management Center (ACMC) that will provide the required communications services and the computational resources that are critically needed by first responders. In our approach to develop an ACMC architecture, we utilize a set of flexible Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) that can be dynamically composed to meet the communications and computational requirements of CM tasks. The ACMC services will be modeled as a deep neural network (DNN) mass transport approach to cover a distributed target in a decentralized manner. This is indeed a new decentralized coverage approach with time-varying communication weights. Furthermore, our analysis proves the stability and convergence of the proposed DNN-based mass transport for a team of UAS (e.g., quadcopters), where each quadcopter uses a feedback nonlinear control to independently attain the intended coverage trajectory in a decentralized manner.",
