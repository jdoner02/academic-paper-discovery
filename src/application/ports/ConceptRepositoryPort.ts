/**
 * ConceptRepositoryPort - Abstract interface for concept data persistence operations.
 * 
 * This port defines the contract for storing and retrieving extracted concepts,
 * demonstrating the Repository pattern in the application layer. It enables
 * the application to persist concept hierarchies without depending on specific
 * storage implementations.
 * 
 * Educational Notes:
 * - Shows Repository pattern for complex domain aggregates (concept hierarchies)
 * - Demonstrates application layer defining its persistence needs
 * - Enables different storage strategies (JSON, database, cache) without code changes
 * - Supports concept evolution and versioning through abstract interface
 * 
 * Design Decisions:
 * - Async operations support various storage backends
 * - Batch operations optimize performance for large concept sets
 * - Query methods enable flexible concept retrieval for visualization
 * - Hierarchical operations respect domain model relationships
 * 
 * Real-World Application:
 * Research concept extraction generates hierarchical data that needs persistent
 * storage for visualization, caching, and incremental updates. This interface
 * allows the application logic to work with concepts without knowing if they're
 * stored in files, databases, or memory.
 * 
 * Integration Points:
 * - Used by ExtractConceptsUseCase to persist extracted concept hierarchies
 * - Used by BuildVisualizationDataUseCase to retrieve concepts for display
 * - Implemented by infrastructure layer (JsonConceptRepository, DatabaseConceptRepository)
 * - Mocked in tests for isolated use case validation
