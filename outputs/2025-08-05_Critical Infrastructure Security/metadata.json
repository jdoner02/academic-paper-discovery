      "abstract": "Distributed control systems (DCS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems were developed to reduce labour costs, and to allow system-wide monitoring and remote control from a central location. Control systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as electric grid, natural gas, water and wastewater industries. While control systems can be vulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating consequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems. American Gas Association (AGA), IEC TC57 WG15, IEEE, NIST and National SCADA Test Bed Program have been actively designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the report AGA 12 part 1. The AGA 12 part 2 has been transferred to IEEE P1711. This paper presents an attack on the protocols in the first draft of AGA standard (Wright et al., 2004). This attack shows that the security mechanisms in the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We then propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems which include: point-to-point secure channels, authenticated broadcast channels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency channels. These protocols are designed to address the specific challenges that SCADA systems have.",

      "abstract": "The cyber-physical system of electricity power networks utilizes supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), which are inherently vulnerable to cyber threats if usually connected with the internet technology (IT). Power system operations are conducted through communication systems that are mapped to standards, protocols, ports, and addresses. Real-time situational awareness is a standard term with implications and applications in both power systems and cybersecurity. In the plausible quantum world (Q-world), conventional approaches will likely face new challenges. The unique art of transmitting a quantum state from one place, Alice, to another, Bob, is known as quantum communication. Quantum communication for SCADA communication in a plausible quantum era thus obviously entails wired communication through optical fiber networks complying with the typical cybersecurity criteria of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for classical internet technology unless a quantum internet (qinternet) transpires practically. When combined with the reverse order of AIC for operational technology, the cybersecurity criteria for power networks' critical infrastructure drill down to more specific sub-areas. Unlike other communication modes, such as information technology (IT) in broadband internet connections, SCADA for power networks, one of the critical infrastructures, is intricately intertwined with operations technology (OT), which significantly increases complexity. Though it is desirable to have a barrier called a demilitarized zone (DMZ), some overlap is inevitable. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges in securing SCADA communication in the plausible quantum computing and communication regime, along with a corresponding integrated Qiskit implementation for possible future framework development.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been used within industry. Referred to as critical infrastructure (CI), key installations such as power stations, water treatment and energy grids are controlled using SCADA. Existing literature reveals inherent security risks to CI and suggests this stems from the rise of interconnected networks, leading to the hypothesis that the rise of interconnectivity between corporate networks and SCADA system networks pose security risks to CI. The results from studies into previous global attacks involving SCADA and CI, with focus on two highly serious incidents in Iran and Ukraine, reveal that although interconnectivity is a major factor, isolated CIs are still highly vulnerable to attack due to risks within the SCADA controllers and protocols.",

Nevertheless, growing cybersecurity threats targeting these infrastructures can potentially interfere with operations and seriously risk national security and public safety. In this paper, we examine the intricate issues raised by cybersecurity risks to vital infrastructure, highlighting these systems' vulnerability to different types of cyberattacks. We analyse the significance of trust, privacy, and resilience for Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP), examining the diverse standards and regulations to manage these domains. We also scrutinise the co-analysis of safety and security, offering innovative approaches for their integration and emphasising the interdependence between these fields. Furthermore, we introduce a comprehensive method for CIP leveraging Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), giving a tailored lifecycle and discussing specific applications across different critical infrastructure sectors. Lastly, we discuss potential future directions that promise to enhance the security and resilience of critical infrastructures. This paper proposes innovative strategies for CIP from evolving attacks and enhances comprehension of cybersecurity concerns related to critical infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Network Control Systems (NAC) have been used in many industrial processes. They aim to reduce the human factor burden and efficiently handle the complex process and communication of those systems. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used in industrial, infrastructure and facility processes (e.g. manufacturing, fabrication, oil and water pipelines, building ventilation, etc.) Like other Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, SCADA systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, therefore, a robust anomaly detection is a major requirement. However, having an accurate anomaly detection system is not an easy task, due to the difficulty to differentiate between cyber-attacks and system internal failures (e.g. hardware failures). In this paper, we present a model that detects anomaly events in a water system controlled by SCADA. Six Machine Learning techniques have been used in building and evaluating the model. The model classifies different anomaly events including hardware failures (e.g. sensor failures), sabotage and cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS and Spoofing). Unlike other detection systems, our proposed work focuses on notifying the operator when an anomaly occurs with a probability of the event occurring. This additional information helps in accelerating the mitigation process. The model is trained and tested using a real-world dataset.",

      "abstract": "Industrial Control System (ICS) is a general term that includes supervisory control & data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as programmable logic controllers (PLC). ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments.",

      "abstract": "Industrial cyber-physical systems (ICPSs) manage critical infrastructures by controlling the processes based on the \"physics\" data gathered by edge sensor networks. Recent innovations in ubiquitous computing and communication technologies have prompted the rapid integration of highly interconnected systems to ICPSs. Hence, the \"security by obscurity\" principle provided by air-gapping is no longer followed. As the interconnectivity in ICPSs increases, so does the attack surface. Industrial vulnerability assessment reports have shown that a variety of new vulnerabilities have occurred due to this transition while the most common ones are related to weak boundary protection. Although there are existing surveys in this context, very little is mentioned regarding these reports. This paper bridges this gap by defining and reviewing ICPSs from a cybersecurity perspective. In particular, multi-dimensional adaptive attack taxonomy is presented and utilized for evaluating real-life ICPS cyber incidents. We also identify the general shortcomings and highlight the points that cause a gap in existing literature while defining future research directions.",

      "abstract": "The increasing adoption of autonomous vehicles is bringing a major shift in the automotive industry. However, as these vehicles become more connected, cybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern. Protecting the security and integrity of autonomous systems is essential to prevent malicious activities that can harm passengers, other road users, and the overall transportation network. This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity issues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved, which are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles depend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external infrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber threats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious problems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very important to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the growth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major cybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks from wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also reviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion detection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry collaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment for autonomous vehicles. Setting clear rules and best practices is necessary for consistent protection across manufacturers and regions. By analyzing the current cybersecurity landscape and suggesting practical countermeasures, this paper aims to contribute to the safe development and public trust of autonomous vehicle technology.",

We examine the evolving regulatory treatment of cloud services as an enabler of the EU's digital economy and question whether all cloud services should be treated as critical infrastructure. Further, we look at how the safeguarding and incident notification obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation ('GDPR') and the Network and Information Systems Directive ('NISD') apply to cloud providers. We also consider the proposed revision of the NISD and look at newly developed voluntary assurance mechanisms for cloud providers, including codes of conduct and certification schemes. We conclude that, since cloud providers are typically subject to both NISD and GDPR and to the jurisdiction of multiple regulators, they face divergent regulatory approaches, which can lead to unintended outcomes and high compliance costs.",

However, there exist high barriers to entry for research and education in the ICS cybersecurity domain due to expensive hardware, software, and inherent dangers of manipulating real-world systems. To close the gap, built upon recently developed 3D high-fidelity simulators, we further showcase our integrated framework to automatically launch cyberattacks, collect data, train machine learning models, and evaluate for practical chemical and manufacturing processes. On our testbed, we validate our proposed intrusion detection model called Minimal Threshold and Window SVM (MinTWin SVM) that utilizes unsupervised machine learning via a one-class SVM in combination with a sliding window and classification threshold. Results show that MinTWin SVM minimizes false positives and is responsive to physical process anomalies. Furthermore, we incorporate our framework with ICS cybersecurity education by using our dataset in an undergraduate machine learning course where students gain hands-on experience in practicing machine learning theory with a practical ICS dataset. All of our implementations have been open-sourced.",

This, in turn, makes it challenging to endow them with fool-proof security solutions. In this paper, a unified model for interdependent gas-power-water infrastructure is presented and the security of this model is studied using a novel game-theoretic framework. In particular, a zero-sum noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation is 35\\% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the interdependent system to protect the grid from state deviations.",

Approaches used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between specificity and generality of application in sectors.",

By utilizing the server-client topology while keeping clients distributed for global protection, high detection rate is achieved with minimum network impact. We implement accurate models of normal-abnormal binary detection and multi-attack identification based on logistic regression and quasi-Newton optimization algorithm using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno approach. The detection system is capable of accelerating detection by information gain based feature selection or principle component analysis based dimension reduction. By evaluating our system using the KDD99 dataset and the industrial control system dataset, we demonstrate that HOIDS is highly scalable, efficient and cost effective for securing SCADA infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems face the absence of a protection technique that can beat different types of intrusions and protect the data from disclosure while handling this data using other applications, specifically Intrusion Detection System (IDS). The SCADA system can manage the critical infrastructure of industrial control environments. Protecting sensitive information is a difficult task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities. The experimental results outperform three techniques in the above terms, showing the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed technique to be utilized for current SCADA systems.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity threats affect all aspects of society; critical infrastructures (such as networks, corporate systems, water supply systems, and intelligent transportation systems) are especially prone to attacks and can have tangible negative consequences on society. However, these critical cyber systems are generally governed by multiple jurisdictions, for instance the Metro in the Washington, D.C. area is managed by the states of Virginia and Maryland, as well as the District of Columbia (DC) through Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA). Additionally, the water treatment infrastructure managed by DC Water consists of waste water input from Fairfax and Arlington counties, and the district (i.e. DC). Additionally, cyber attacks usually launch from unknown sources, through unknown switches and servers, and end up at the destination without much knowledge on their source or path. Certain infrastructures are shared amongst multiple countries, another idiosyncrasy that exacerbates the issue of governance. This law paper however, is not concerned with the general governance of these infrastructures, rather with the ambiguity in the relevant laws or doctrines about which authority would prevail in the context of a cyber threat or a cyber-attack, with a focus on federal vs. state issues, international law involvement, federal preemption, technical aspects that could affect lawmaking, and conflicting responsibilities in cases of cyber crime. A legal analysis of previous cases is presented, as well as an extended discussion addressing different sides of the argument.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity concerns of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and infrastructure are growing each year. In response, organizations worldwide have published IoT security guidelines to protect their citizens and customers by providing recommendations on the development and operation of IoT systems. While these guidelines are being adopted, e.g. by US federal contractors, their content and merits have not been critically examined. Specifically, we do not know what topics and recommendations they cover and their effectiveness at preventing real-world IoT failures. In this paper, we address these gaps through a qualitative study of guidelines. We collect 142 IoT cybersecurity guidelines and sample them for recommendations until reaching saturation at 25 guidelines. From the resulting 958 unique recommendations, we iteratively develop a hierarchical taxonomy following grounded theory coding principles and study the guidelines' comprehensiveness. In addition, we evaluate the actionability and specificity of each recommendation and match recommendations to CVEs and security failures in the news they can prevent. We report that: (1) Each guideline has gaps in its topic coverage and comprehensiveness; (2) 87.2% recommendations are actionable and 38.7% recommendations can prevent specific threats; and (3) although the union of the guidelines mitigates all 17 of the failures from our news stories corpus, 21% of the CVEs evade the guidelines. In summary, we report shortcomings in each guideline's depth and breadth, but as a whole they address major security issues.",

As there is a lack of host-based intrusion detection systems specifically designed for the stable nature of SCADA systems, the objective of this work is to propose a host-based intrusion detection system tailored for SCADA systems in smart grids. The proposed system utilizes USB device identification, flagging, and process memory scanning to monitor and detect anomalies in SCADA systems, providing enhanced security measures. Evaluation in three different scenarios demonstrates the tool's effectiveness in detecting and disabling malware. The proposed approach effectively identifies potential threats and enhances the security of SCADA systems in smart grids, providing a promising solution to protect against cyberattacks.",

However, the heterogeneous nature of IoT data and the lack of human-comprehensible insights from anomaly detection models remain significant challenges. This paper presents a hybrid framework that combines numerical anomaly detection using Autoencoders with Large Language Models (LLMs) for enhanced preprocessing and interpretability. Two preprocessing approaches are implemented: a traditional method utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality and an LLM-assisted method where GPT-4 dynamically recommends feature selection, transformation, and encoding strategies.   Experimental results on the KDDCup99 10% corrected dataset demonstrate that the LLM-assisted preprocessing pipeline significantly improves anomaly detection performance. The macro-average F1 score increased from 0.49 in the traditional PCA-based approach to 0.98 with LLM-driven insights. Additionally, the LLM generates natural language explanations for detected anomalies, providing contextual insights into their causes and implications. This framework highlights the synergy between numerical AI models and LLMs, delivering an accurate, interpretable, and efficient solution for IoT cybersecurity in critical infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "The machinery of industrial environments was connected to the Internet years ago with the scope of increasing their performance. However, this change made such environments vulnerable against cyber-attacks that can compromise their correct functioning resulting in economic or social problems. Moreover, implementing cryptosystems in the communications between operational technology (OT) devices is a more challenging task than for information technology (IT) environments since the OT networks are generally composed of legacy elements, characterized by low-computational capabilities. Consequently, implementing cryptosystems in industrial communication networks faces a trade-off between the security of the communications and the amortization of the industrial infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure (CI) refers to the industries which provide key resources for the daily social and economical development, e.g. electricity. Furthermore, a new threat to cybersecurity has arisen with the theoretical proposal of quantum computers, due to their potential ability of breaking state-of-the-art cryptography protocols, such as RSA or ECC. Many global agents have become aware that transitioning their secure communications to a quantum secure paradigm is a priority that should be established before the arrival of fault-tolerance. In this paper, we aim to describe the problematic of implementing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to CI environments. For doing so, we describe the requirements for these scenarios and how they differ against IT. We also introduce classical cryptography and how quantum computers pose a threat to such security protocols. Furthermore, we introduce state-of-the-art proposals of PQC protocols and present their characteristics. We conclude by discussing the problematic of integrating PQC in industrial environments.",

This qualitative research employs systematic document analysis and comparative case study methodology to examine how cybersecurity organizations adapt their threat modeling frameworks and operational processes to address generative artificial intelligence integration. Through examination of 25 studies from 2022 to 2025, the research documents substantial transformation in organizational approaches to threat modeling, moving from traditional signature-based systems toward frameworks incorporating artificial intelligence capabilities. The research identifies three primary adaptation patterns: Large Language Model integration for security applications, GenAI frameworks for risk detection and response automation, and AI/ML integration for threat hunting. Organizations with mature security infrastructures, particularly in finance and critical infrastructure sectors, demonstrate higher readiness through structured governance approaches, dedicated AI teams, and robust incident response processes. Organizations achieve successful GenAI integration when they maintain appropriate human oversight of automated systems, address data quality concerns and explainability requirements, and establish governance frameworks tailored to their specific sectors. Organizations encounter ongoing difficulties with privacy protection, bias reduction, personnel training, and defending against adversarial attacks. This work advances understanding of how organizations adopt innovative technologies in high-stakes environments and offers actionable insights for cybersecurity professionals implementing GenAI systems.",

      "abstract": "Critical infrastructures (CI) and industrial organizations aggressively move towards integrating elements of modern Information Technology (IT) into their monolithic Operational Technology (OT) architectures. Yet, as OT systems progressively become more and more interconnected, they silently have turned into alluring targets for diverse groups of adversaries. Meanwhile, the inherent complexity of these systems, along with their advanced-in-age nature, prevents defenders from fully applying contemporary security controls in a timely manner. Forsooth, the combination of these hindering factors has led to some of the most severe cybersecurity incidents of the past years. This work contributes a full-fledged and up-to-date survey of the most prominent threats against Industrial Control Systems (ICS) along with the communication protocols and devices adopted in these environments. Our study highlights that threats against CI follow an upward spiral due to the mushrooming of commodity tools and techniques that can facilitate either the early or late stages of attacks. Furthermore, our survey exposes that existing vulnerabilities in the design and implementation of several of the OT-specific network protocols may easily grant adversaries the ability to decisively impact physical processes. We provide a categorization of such threats and the corresponding vulnerabilities based on various criteria. As far as we are aware, this is the first time an exhaustive and detailed survey of this kind is attempted.",

This surge in GAI technology has ushered in not only innovative opportunities for data processing and automation but has also introduced significant cybersecurity challenges.   As GAI rapidly progresses, it outstrips the current pace of cybersecurity protocols and regulatory frameworks, leading to a paradox wherein the same innovations meant to safeguard digital infrastructures also enhance the arsenal available to cyber criminals. These adversaries, adept at swiftly integrating and exploiting emerging technologies, may utilize GAI to develop malware that is both more covert and adaptable, thus complicating traditional cybersecurity efforts.   The acceleration of GAI presents an ambiguous frontier for cybersecurity experts, offering potent tools for threat detection and response, while concurrently providing cyber attackers with the means to engineer more intricate and potent malware. Through the joint efforts of Duke Pratt School of Engineering, Coalfire, and Safebreach, this research undertakes a meticulous analysis of how malicious agents are exploiting GAI to augment their attack strategies, emphasizing a critical issue for the integrity of future cybersecurity initiatives. The study highlights the critical need for organizations to proactively identify and develop more complex defensive strategies to counter the sophisticated employment of GAI in malware creation.",

      "abstract": "Critical infrastructure protection (CIP) is envisioned to be one of the most challenging security problems in the coming decade. One key challenge in CIP is the ability to allocate resources, either personnel or cyber, to critical infrastructures with different vulnerability and criticality levels. In this work, a contract-theoretic approach is proposed to solve the problem of resource allocation in critical infrastructure with asymmetric information. A control center (CC) is used to design contracts and offer them to infrastructures' owners. A contract can be seen as an agreement between the CC and infrastructures using which the CC allocates resources and gets rewards in return. Contracts are designed in a way to maximize the CC's benefit and motivate each infrastructure to accept a contract and obtain proper resources for its protection. Infrastructures are defined by both vulnerability levels and criticality levels which are unknown to the CC. Therefore, each infrastructure can claim that it is the most vulnerable or critical to gain more resources. A novel mechanism is developed to handle such an asymmetric information while providing the optimal contract that motivates each infrastructure to reveal its actual type. The necessary and sufficient conditions for such resource allocation contracts under asymmetric information are derived. Simulation results show that the proposed contract-theoretic approach maximizes the CC's utility while ensuring that no infrastructure has an incentive to ask for another contract, despite the lack of exact information at the CC.",

      "abstract": "The automotive industry has evolved significantly since the introduction of the Ford Model T in 1908. Today's vehicles are not merely mechanical constructs; they are integral components of a complex digital ecosystem, equipped with advanced connectivity features powered by Artificial Intelligence and cloud computing technologies. This evolution has enhanced vehicle safety, efficiency, and the overall driving experience. However, it also introduces new challenges, notably in cybersecurity.   With the increasing integration of digital technologies, vehicles have become more susceptible to cyber-attacks, prompting significant cybersecurity concerns. These concerns include securing sensitive data, protecting vehicles from unauthorized access, and ensuring user privacy. In response, the automotive industry is compelled to adopt robust cybersecurity measures to safeguard both vehicles and data against potential threats.   Legislative frameworks such as UNR155 and UNR156 by the United Nations, along with other international regulations, aim to establish stringent cybersecurity mandates. These regulations require compliance with comprehensive cybersecurity management systems and necessitate regular updates and testing to cope with the evolving nature of cyber threats. The introduction of such regulations highlights the growing recognition of cybersecurity as a critical component of automotive safety and functionality.   The future of automotive cybersecurity lies in the continuous development of advanced protective measures and collaborative efforts among all stakeholders, including manufacturers, policymakers, and cybersecurity professionals. Only through such concerted efforts can the industry hope to address the dual goals of innovation in vehicle functionality and stringent security measures against the backdrop of an increasingly interconnected digital landscape.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of modern technology, critical infrastructure, communications, and national security depend increasingly on space-based assets. These assets, along with associated assets like data relay systems and ground stations, are, therefore, in serious danger of cyberattacks. Strong security defenses are essential to ensure data integrity, maintain secure operations, and protect assets in space and on the ground against various threats. Previous research has found discrete vulnerabilities in space systems and suggested specific solutions to address them. Such research has yielded valuable insights, but lacks a thorough examination of space cyberattack vectors and a rigorous assessment of the efficacy of mitigation techniques. This study tackles this issue by taking a comprehensive approach to analyze the range of possible space cyber-attack vectors, which include ground, space, satellite, and satellite constellations. In order to address the particular threats, the study also assesses the efficacy of mitigation measures that are linked with space infrastructures and proposes a Risk Scoring Framework. Based on the analysis, this paper identifies potential research challenges for developing and testing cutting-edge technology solutions, encouraging robust cybersecurity measures needed in space.",

      "abstract": "Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.",

      "abstract": "Climate change increases the frequency of extreme rainfall, placing a significant strain on urban infrastructures, especially Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overflows from overburdened CSS release untreated wastewater into surface waters, posing environmental and public health risks. Although traditional physics-based models are effective, they are costly to maintain and difficult to adapt to evolving system dynamics. Machine Learning (ML) approaches offer cost-efficient alternatives with greater adaptability. To systematically assess the potential of ML for modeling urban infrastructure systems, we propose a protocol for evaluating Neural Network architectures for CSS time series forecasting with respect to predictive performance, model complexity, and robustness to perturbations. In addition, we assess model performance on peak events and critical fluctuations, as these are the key regimes for urban wastewater management. To investigate the feasibility of lightweight models suitable for IoT deployment, we compare global models, which have access to all information, with local models, which rely solely on nearby sensor readings. Additionally, to explore the security risks posed by network outages or adversarial attacks on urban infrastructure, we introduce error models that assess the resilience of models. Our results demonstrate that while global models achieve higher predictive performance, local models provide sufficient resilience in decentralized scenarios, ensuring robust modeling of urban infrastructure. Furthermore, models with longer native forecast horizons exhibit greater robustness to data perturbations. These findings contribute to the development of interpretable and reliable ML solutions for sustainable urban wastewater management. The implementation is available in our GitHub repository.",

The dependency of new power grid technology on information, data analytic and communication systems make the entire electricity network vulnerable to cyber threats. Power transformers play a critical role within the power grid and are now commonly enhanced through factory add-ons or intelligent monitoring systems added later to improve the condition monitoring of critical and long lead time assets such as transformers. However, the increased connectivity of those power transformers opens the door to more cyber attacks. Therefore, the need to detect and prevent cyber threats is becoming critical. The first step towards that would be a deeper understanding of the potential cyber-attacks landscape against power transformers. Much of the existing literature pays attention to smart equipment within electricity distribution networks, and most methods proposed are based on model-based detection algorithms. Moreover, only a few of these works address the security vulnerabilities of power elements, especially transformers within the transmission network. To the best of our knowledge, there is no study in the literature that systematically investigate the cybersecurity challenges against the newly emerged smart transformers. This paper addresses this shortcoming by exploring the vulnerabilities and the attack vectors of power transformers within electricity networks, the possible attack scenarios and the risks associated with these attacks.",
