      "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has the potential to radically improve healthcare by enabling real-time monitoring, remote diagnostics, and AI-driven decision making. However, the connectivity, embedded intelligence, and inclusion of a wide variety of novel sensors expose medical devices to severe cybersecurity threats, compromising patient safety and data privacy. In addition, many devices also have direct capacity - individually or in conjunction with other IoMT devices - to perform actions on the patient, such as delivering an electrical stimulus, administering a drug, or activating a motor, which can potentially be life-threatening. We provide a taxonomy of potential attacks targeting IoMT, presenting attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies across all layers of the IoMT architecture. It answers key questions such as: What makes IoMT security different from traditional IT security? What are the cybersecurity threats to medical devices? How can engineers design secure IoMT systems and protect hospital networks from cyberattacks? By analyzing historical cyber incidents, we highlight critical security gaps and propose practical security guidelines for medical device engineers and security professionals. This work bridges the gap between research and implementation, equipping healthcare stakeholders with actionable insights to build resilient and privacy-preserving IoMT ecosystems. Finally, we present the latest standardization and compliance frameworks, that IoMT security designers should be aware of.",

      "abstract": "The medical device products at the European Union market must be safe and effective. To ensure this, medical device manufacturers must comply to the new regulatory requirements brought by the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the In Vitro Diagnostic Medical Device Regulation (IVDR). In general, the new regulations increase regulatory requirements and oversight, especially for medical software, and this is also true for requirements related to cybersecurity, which are now explicitly addressed in the legislation. The significant legislation changes currently underway, combined with increased cybersecurity requirements, create unique challenges for manufacturers to comply with the regulatory framework. In this paper, we review the new cybersecurity requirements in the light of currently available guidance documents, and pinpoint four core concepts around which cybersecurity compliance can be built. We argue that these core concepts form a foundations for cybersecurity compliance in the European Union regulatory framework.",

      "abstract": "The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.",

These devices have gained user interest as they are easy to use. However, medical devices introduce extra complexity to the network by being numerous, heterogeneous, and more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. For better network management and overall network security, it is important to understand the network traffic characteristics of the devices. Thus, in this paper, we analyze in detail the traffic characteristics of 8 medical devices both at the device level and at the level of individual functionality of each device. We collect and share both network and Bluetooth traffic from a total of 51 functionalities of the devices. Our analysis includes different metrics such as protocols, amount of incoming/outgoing traffic, DNS queries, and analysis of traffic destinations. We observed that devices have unique network and Bluetooth traffic characteristics, that might be useful in developing networking tools for medical devices.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, focus on the security and privacy aspects of implantable medical devices (IMDs) has intensified, driven by the multitude of cybersecurity vulnerabilities found in various existing devices. However, due to their strict computational, energy and physical constraints, conventional security protocols are not directly applicable to IMDs. Custom-tailored schemes have been proposed instead which, however, fail to cover the full spectrum of security features that modern IMDs and their ecosystems so critically require. In this paper we propose IMDfence, a security protocol for IMD ecosystems that provides a comprehensive yet practical security portfolio, which includes availability, non-repudiation, access control, entity authentication, remote monitoring and system scalability. The protocol also allows emergency access that results in the graceful degradation of offered services without compromising security and patient safety. The performance of the security protocol as well as its feasibility and impact on modern IMDs are extensively analyzed and evaluated. We find that IMDfence achieves the above security requirements at a mere less than 7% increase in total IMD energy consumption, and less than 14 ms and 9 kB increase in system delay and memory footprint, respectively.",

We conducted a comprehensive search across leading databases such as ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, and Elsevier to analyze peer-reviewed studies published within the last five years (from 2019 to 2024). The review shows that inadequate encryption protocols, weak authentication methods, and irregular firmware updates are the main causes of risks associated with IoMT devices. We have identified emerging solutions like machine learning algorithms, blockchain technology, and edge computing as promising approaches to enhance IoMT security. This review emphasizes the pressing need to develop lightweight security measures and standardized protocols to protect patient data and ensure the integrity of healthcare services.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by reducing human error and improving patient health. For instance, wearable smart infusion pumps can accurately administer medication and integrate with electronic health records. These pumps can alert healthcare professionals or remote servers when an operation fails, preventing distressing incidents. However, as the number of connected medical devices increases, so does the risk of cyber threats. Wearable medication devices based on IoT attached to patients' bodies are particularly vulnerable to significant cyber threats. Since they are connected to the internet, these devices can be exposed to potential harm, which can disrupt or degrade device performance and harm patients. Therefore, it is crucial to establish secure data authentication for internet-connected medical devices to ensure patient safety and well-being. It is also important to note that the wearability option of such devices might downgrade the computational resources, making them more susceptible to security risks. We propose implementing a security approach for a wearable infusion pump to mitigate cyber threats. We evaluated the proposed architecture with 20, 50, and 100 users for 10 minutes and repeated the evaluation 10 times with two infusion settings, each repeated five times. The desired volumes and rates for the two settings were 2 ml and 4 ml/hr and 5 ml and 5 ml/hr, respectively. The maximum error in infusion rate was measured to be 2.5%. We discuss the practical challenges of implementing such a security-enabled device and suggest initial solutions.",

With the discovery of thousands of vulnerabilities each month, there is a pressing need to drive the automation of vulnerability assessment processes for medical devices, facilitating rapid mitigation efforts. Generative AI systems have revolutionized various industries, offering unparalleled opportunities for automation and increased efficiency. This paper presents a solution leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to learn from historical evaluations of vulnerabilities for the automatic assessment of vulnerabilities in the medical devices industry. This approach is applied within the portfolio of a single manufacturer, taking into account device characteristics, including existing security posture and controls. The primary contributions of this paper are threefold. Firstly, it provides a detailed examination of the best practices for training a vulnerability Language Model (LM) in an industrial context. Secondly, it presents a comprehensive comparison and insightful analysis of the effectiveness of Language Models in vulnerability assessment.

      "abstract": "Medical devices and artificial intelligence systems rapidly transform healthcare provisions. At the same time, due to their nature, AI in or as medical devices might get exposed to cyberattacks, leading to patient safety and security risks. This book chapter is divided into three parts. The first part starts by setting the scene where we explain the role of cybersecurity in healthcare. Then, we briefly define what we refer to when we talk about AI that is considered a medical device by itself or supports one. To illustrate the risks such medical devices pose, we provide three examples: the poisoning of datasets, social engineering, and data or source code extraction. In the second part, the paper provides an overview of the European Union's regulatory framework relevant for ensuring the cybersecurity of AI as or in medical devices (MDR, NIS Directive, Cybersecurity Act, GDPR, the AI Act proposal and the NIS 2 Directive proposal). Finally, the third part of the paper examines possible challenges stemming from the EU regulatory framework. In particular, we look toward the challenges deriving from the two legislative proposals and their interaction with the existing legislation concerning AI medical devices' cybersecurity. They are structured as answers to the following questions: (1) how will the AI Act interact with the MDR regarding the cybersecurity and safety requirements?; (2) how should we interpret incident notification requirements from the NIS 2 Directive proposal and MDR?; and (3) what are the consequences of the evolving term of critical infrastructures?

      "abstract": "To facilitate monitoring and management, modern Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are often equipped with wireless capabilities, which raise the risk of malicious access to IMDs. Although schemes are proposed to secure the IMD access, some issues are still open. First, pre-sharing a long-term key between a patient's IMD and a doctor's programmer is vulnerable since once the doctor's programmer is compromised, all of her patients suffer; establishing a temporary key by leveraging proximity gets rid of pre-shared keys, but as the approach lacks real authentication, it can be exploited by nearby adversaries or through man-in-the-middle attacks. Second, while prolonging the lifetime of IMDs is one of the most important design goals, few schemes explore to lower the communication and computation overhead all at once. Finally, how to safely record the commands issued by doctors for the purpose of forensics, which can be the last measure to protect the patients' rights, is commonly omitted in the existing literature. Motivated by these important yet open problems, we propose an innovative scheme e-SAFE, which significantly improves security and safety, reduces the communication overhead and enables IMD-access forensics. We present a novel lightweight compressive sensing based encryption algorithm to encrypt and compress the IMD data simultaneously, reducing the data transmission overhead by over 50% while ensuring high data confidentiality and usability. Furthermore, we provide a suite of protocols regarding device pairing, dual-factor authentication, and accountability-enabled access. The security analysis and performance evaluation show the validity and efficiency of the proposed scheme.",

In this study, we present the Threat identification, ontology-based Likelihood, severity Decomposition, and Risk integration (TLDR) methodology for information security risk assessment for medical devices. The TLDR methodology uses the following steps: (1) identifying the potentially vulnerable components of medical devices, in this case, four different medical imaging devices (MIDs); (2) identifying the potential attacks, in this case, 23 potential attacks on MIDs; (3) mapping the discovered attacks into a known attack ontology - in this case, the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classifications (CAPECs); (4) estimating the likelihood of the mapped CAPECs in the medical domain with the assistance of a panel of senior healthcare Information Security Experts (ISEs); (5) computing the CAPEC-based likelihood estimates of each attack; (6) decomposing each attack into several severity aspects and assigning them weights; (7) assessing the magnitude of the impact of each of the severity aspects for each attack with the assistance of a panel of senior Medical Experts (MEs); (8) computing the composite severity assessments for each attack; and finally, (9) integrating the likelihood and severity of each attack into its risk, and thus prioritizing it.

It introduces a systematic three-tier framework to analyze IoMT networks and identify application scenarios. The paper examines the medical data transmission process, including intra-wireless Body Area Networks (WBAN), inter-WBAN, and beyond-WBAN communications. It also discusses the challenges of implementing IoMT applications, such as the longevity of biosensors, co-channel interference management, information security, and data processing delays.

      "abstract": "The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) offers a promising solution to improve patient health and reduce human error. Wearable smart infusion pumps that accurately administer medication and integrate with electronic health records are an example of technology that can improve healthcare. They can even alert healthcare professionals or remote servers during operational failure, preventing distressing incidents. However, as the number of connected medical devices increases, the risk of cyber threats also increases. Wearable medication devices based on IoT attached to patients' bodies are prone to significant cyber threats. Being connected to the Internet exposes these devices to potential harm, which could disrupt or degrade device performance and harm patients. To ensure patient safety and well-being, it is crucial to establish secure data authentication for internet-connected medical devices. It is also important to note that the wearability option of such devices might downgrade the computational resources, making them more susceptible to security risks. This paper implements a security approach to a wearable infusion pump. We discuss practical challenges in implementing security-enabled devices and propose initial solutions to mitigate cyber threats.",

      "abstract": "How do healthcare organizations (from small Practices to large HDOs) evaluate adherence to the cybersecurity and privacy protection of Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) used in clinical settings? This paper suggests an approach for such evaluation using National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance. Through application of NISTIR 8228 Expectations it is possible to quantitatively assess cybersecurity and privacy protection, and determine relative compliance with recommended standards. This approach allows organizations to evaluate the level of risk a MiOT device poses to IT systems and to determine whether or not to permit its use in healthcare/IT environments.   This paper reviews the current state of IoT/MiOT cybersecurity and privacy protection using historical and current industry guidance & best-practices; recommendations by federal agencies; NIST publications; and federal law. It then presents similarities and differences between IOT/MiOT devices and \"traditional\" (or classic) Information Technology (IT) hardware, and cites several challenges IoT/MiOT pose to cybersecurity and privacy protection.   Finally, a practical approach to evaluating cybersecurity and privacy protection is offered along with enhancements for validating assessment results. In so doing it will demonstrate general compliance with both NIST guidance and HIPAA/HITECH requirements.",

Finally, the firmware extraction is performed allowing further analysis of the firmware inside the device as well as real-time debugging. This paper also evaluates the security of the main controller IC of the device. It reveals some weaknesses in the device design process which lead to the possibility of the successful teardown. Should the hardware security of the controller inside the device was well thought through, the teardown process would be far more complicated. This paper demonstrates what the typical teardown process of a personal medical device involves. This knowledge could help in improving the hardware security of sensitive devices.",

IoMT is an emerging technology that improves patients' quality of life by permitting personalized e-health services without restrictions on time and site. The IoMT consists of embedded objects, sensors, and actuators that transmit and receive medical data. These Medical devices are vulnerable to different types of security threats, and thus, they pose a significant risk to patient's privacy and safety. Because security is a critical factor for successfully merging IoMT into pervasive healthcare systems, there is an urgent need for new security mechanisms to prevent threats on the IoMT edge network. Toward this direction, the first step is defining an attack vector that an attacker or unauthorized user can take advantage of to penetrate and tamper with medical data. In this article, we specify a threat model for the IoMT edge network. We identify any vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the IoMT network that allow unauthorized privileges and threats that can utilize these weaknesses to compromise the IoMT edge network. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of IoMT threats based on the Markov transition probability matrix.",

Through the internet, the IoMT is capable of providing remote medical diagnosis and timely health services. The patients can use their smart devices to create, store and share their electronic health records (EHR) with a variety of medical personnel including medical doctors and nurses. However, unless the underlying combination within IoMT is secured, malicious users can intercept, modify and even delete the sensitive EHR data of patients. Patients also lose full control of their EHR since most health services within IoMT are constructed under a centralized platform outsourced in the cloud. Therefore, it is appealing to design a decentralized, auditable and secure EHR system that guarantees absolute access control for the patients while ensuring privacy and security. Using the features of blockchain including decentralization, auditability and immutability, we propose a secure EHR framework which is mainly maintained by the medical centers. In this framework, the patients' EHR data are encrypted and stored in the servers of medical institutions while the corresponding hash values are kept on the blockchain. We make use of security primitives to offer authentication, integrity and confidentiality of EHR data while access control and immutability is guaranteed by the blockchain technology. The security analysis and performance evaluation of the proposed framework confirms its efficiency.",

In this paper, we propose a system for postmortem analysis of lethal attack scenarios targeting cardiac IMDs. Such a system reconciles in the same framework conclusions derived by technical investigators and deductions generated by pathologists. An inference system integrating a library of medical rules is used to automatically infer potential medical scenarios that could have led to the death of a patient. A Model Checking based formal technique allowing the reconstruction of potential technical attack scenarios on the IMD, starting from the collected evidence, is also proposed.

However, the rapid examination of large populations poses challenges, including the risk of fraudulent practices by healthcare professionals and social workers exchanging unverified images via mobile applications. To mitigate these risks, this study proposes using watermarking techniques to embed a device fingerprint (DFP) into captured images, ensuring data provenance. The DFP, representing the unique attributes of the capturing device and raw image, is embedded into raw images before storage, thus enabling verification of image authenticity and source. Moreover, a robust remote validation method is introduced to authenticate images, enhancing the integrity of medical image data in interconnected healthcare systems. Through a case study on mobile fundus imaging, the effectiveness of the proposed framework is evaluated in terms of computational efficiency, image quality, security, and trustworthiness. This approach is suitable for a range of applications, including telemedicine, the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), eHealth, and Medical Cyber-Physical Systems (MCPS) applications, providing a reliable means to maintain data provenance in diagnostic settings utilizing medical images or videos.",

In this case study, we evaluate CASCADE, an approach for building SAC in the context of a large medical device manufacturer with an established agile development workflow. We investigate the regulatory context as well as the adaptations needed in the development process. Our results show the suitability of SACs in the medical device industry. We identified 17 use cases in which an SAC supports internal and external needs. The connection to safety assurance can be achieved by incorporating information from the risk assessment matrix into the SAC. Integration into the development process can be achieved by introducing a new role and rules for the design review and the release to production as well as additional criteria for the definition of done. We also show that SACs built with CASCADE fulfill the requirements of relevant standards in the medical domain such as ISO 14971.",

Although these devices can offer convenience to consumers, more and more reports are warning of the cybersecurity risks of such devices, and the possibilities for such devices to be hacked and used as springboards to other systems. Due to their wireless transmissions, these devices can potentially be vulnerable to a malicious attack allowing the data collected to be exposed. The vulnerabilities of these devices stem from lack of authentication, disadvantages of Bluetooth connections, location tracking as well as third party vulnerabilities.

Our proposed solution satisfies these needs by making use of the AIDA system and many cutting-edge techniques to build a digitalized management system. To be more specific, we present firstly the AIDA document exchange framework for the management (creation, search, storage) of e-docs expressed in XML format. The framework provides security services, like privacy, authorization, authentication and non-repudiation. We describe next the use of AIDA in a real world medical service, namely the creation of electronic medical records (e- MRs). Doctors can use mobile devices that embed a secure trustworthy environment defined also in AIDA for digitally signing the e-MRs. Technically speaking a handheld PC equipped with a smart-card reader and integrating What You See Is What You Sign (WYSIWYS) features will be used for viewing and signing the e-MRs. Furthermore the proposed system is easily integrated with the infrastructure (e.g., database system) already in use at hospital's administration site and allows easy handling and updating of data processed on the mobile devices. The use of web interface for the operations to be executed on the mobile device or for those executed on the remote part of the system makes the whole application homogeneous and easy to use.",

      "abstract": "The rapid evolutions in micro-computing, mini-hardware manufacturing, and machine to machine (M2M) communications have enabled novel Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to reshape many networking applications. Healthcare systems are among these applications that have been revolutionized with IoT, introducing an IoT branch known as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) systems. IoMT systems allow remote monitoring of patients with chronic diseases. Thus, it can provide timely patients' diagnostic that can save their life in case of emergencies. However, security in these critical systems is a major challenge facing their wide utilization. In this paper, we present state-of-the-art techniques to secure IoMT systems' data during collection, transmission, and storage. We comprehensively overview IoMT systems' potential attacks, including physical and network attacks. Our findings reveal that most security techniques do not consider various types of attacks. Hence, we propose a security framework that combines several security techniques. The framework covers IoMT security requirements and can mitigate most of its known attacks.",

      "abstract": "The Medical Internet of Things (MIoT) has enabled small, ubiquitous medical devices to communicate with each other to facilitate interconnected healthcare delivery. These devices interact using communication protocols like MQTT, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi. However, as MIoT devices proliferate, these networked devices are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. This paper focuses on the vulnerabilities present in the Message Queuing Telemetry and Transport (MQTT) protocol. The MQTT protocol is prone to cyber-attacks that can harm the system's functionality. The memory-constrained MIoT devices enforce a limitation on storing all data logs that are required for comprehensive network forensics. This paper solves the data log availability challenge by detecting the attack in real-time and storing the corresponding logs for further analysis with the proposed network forensics framework: MediHunt. Machine learning (ML) techniques are the most real safeguard against cyber-attacks. However, these models require a specific dataset that covers diverse attacks on the MQTT-based IoT system for training. The currently available datasets do not encompass a variety of applications and TCP layer attacks. To address this issue, we leveraged the usage of a flow-based dataset containing flow data for TCP/IP layer and application layer attacks. Six different ML models are trained with the generated dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the MediHunt framework in detecting real-time attacks. F1 scores and detection accuracy exceeded 0.99 for the proposed MediHunt framework with our custom dataset.",

(2024), an estimated 75 billion devices will be on the market in 2025. The healthcare industry is a target to improve patient care and ease healthcare provider burdens. Chronic respiratory disease is likely to benefit from their inclusion, with 545 million people worldwide recorded to suffer from patients using these devices to track their dosage. At the same time, healthcare providers can improve medication administration and monitor respiratory health (Soriano et al., 2020). While IoT medical devices offer numerous benefits, they also have security vulnerabilities that can expose patient data to cyberattacks. It's crucial to prioritize security measures in developing and deploying IoT medical devices, especially in personalized health monitoring systems for individuals with respiratory conditions. Efforts are underway to assess the security risks associated with intelligent inhalers and respiratory medical devices by understanding usability behavior and technological elements to identify and address vulnerabilities effectively. This work analyses usability behavior and technical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the confidentiality of information gained from Smart Inhalers. It then extrapolates to interrogate potential vulnerabilities with Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs). Our work explores the tensions in device development through the intersection of IoT technology and respiratory health, particularly in the context of intelligent inhalers and other breathing medical devices, calling for integrating robust security measures into the development and deployment of IoT devices to safeguard patient data and ensure the secure functioning of these critical healthcare technologies.",

However, security attacks, malfunctions and sometimes user errors have raised great concerns regarding the safety of IWMDs. In this work, we present a HW/SW (Hardware/Software) framework for improving the safety of IWMDs, wherein a set of safety rules and a rule check mechanism are used to monitor both the extrinsic state (the patient's physiological parameters sensed by the IWMD) and the internal state of the IWMD (I/O activities of the microcontroller) to infer unsafe operations that may be triggered by user errors, software bugs, or security attacks. We discuss how this approach can be realized in the context of a artificial pancreas with wireless connectivity and implement a prototype to demonstrate its effectiveness in improving safety at modest overheads.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Used extensively in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease, Medical Imaging Devices (MIDs), such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) machines, play an important role in medicine today. MIDs are increasingly connected to hospital networks, making them vulnerable to sophisticated cyber-attacks targeting the devices' infrastructure and components, which can disrupt digital patient records, and potentially jeopardize patients' health. Attacks on MIDs are likely to increase, as attackers' skills improve and the number of unpatched devices with known vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited grows. Attackers may also block access to MIDs or disable them, as part of ransomware attacks, which have been shown to be successful against hospitals. Method and Materials: We conducted a comprehensive risk analysis survey at the Malware-Lab, based on the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) model, in collaboration with our country's largest health maintenance organization, to define the characteristics of cyber-attacks on MIDs. The survey includes a range of vulnerabilities and potential attacks aimed at MIDs, medical and imaging information systems, and medical protocols and standards such as DICOM and HL7. Results: Based on our survey, we found that CT devices face the greatest risk of cyber-attack, due to their pivotal role in acute care imaging. Thus, we identified several possible attack vectors that target the infrastructure and functionality of CT devices, which can cause: 1. Disruption of the parameters' values used in the scanning protocols within the CT devices (e.g., tampering with the radiation exposure levels); 2. Mechanical disruption of the CT device (e.g., changing the pitch); 3. Disruption of the tomography scan signals constructing the digital images; and 4. Denial-of-Service attacks against the CT device.",

Many IoT devices are released to the market with minimal security measures, often harbouring an average of 25 vulnerabilities per device. To enhance cybersecurity measures and aid system administrators in managing IoT patches more effectively, we propose an innovative framework that predicts the time it will take for a vulnerable IoT device to receive a fix or patch. We developed a survival analysis model based on the Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) approach, implemented using the XGBoost ensemble regression model, to predict when vulnerable IoT devices will receive fixes or patches. By constructing a comprehensive IoT vulnerabilities database that combines public and private sources, we provide insights into affected devices, vulnerability detection dates, published CVEs, patch release dates, and associated Twitter activity trends. We conducted thorough experiments evaluating different combinations of features, including fundamental device and vulnerability data, National Vulnerability Database (NVD) information such as CVE, CWE, and CVSS scores, transformed textual descriptions into sentence vectors, and the frequency of Twitter trends related to CVEs. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the time to fix for IoT vulnerabilities, with data from VulDB and NVD proving particularly effective. Incorporating Twitter trend data offered minimal additional benefit. This framework provides a practical tool for organisations to anticipate vulnerability resolutions, improve IoT patch management, and strengthen their cybersecurity posture against potential threats.",

      "abstract": "Medical Internet of Things (IoMT) is the next frontier in the digital revolution and is utilized in healthcare. In this context, IoT enables individuals to remotely manage their essential activities with minimal interaction. However, the limitations of network resources and the challenges of establishing a secure channel, as well as sharing and collecting sensitive information through an insecure public channel, pose security challenges for the medical IoT. This paper presents a lightweight multi-factor authentication and anonymous user authentication scheme to access real-time data in a blockchain-based environment. The scheme utilizes an insecure channel called L2AI. L2AI ensures security and efficiency while enhancing user anonymity through the use of pseudo-identity and dynamic indexing. The proposed method supports highly scalable systems with an efficient user registration process, allowing authenticated users to access both existing and newly added system entities without additional processes. Although the scheme is primarily designed for large systems, such as health infrastructure, it is also suitable for resource-constrained devices. The scheme relies on one-way cryptographic hashing functions and bitwise XOR operations. Additionally, a fuzzy mining algorithm is employed on the user side to verify the user's biometric information. L2AI adopts the \"Real-Or-Random (ROR)\" model for security proof and employs BAN logic for proof of authenticity. Formal security verification is conducted using the \"Automatic Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Programs\" (Proverif) tool, complemented by informal security analysis demonstrating the proper functionality of L2AI.",

Digital signatures offer scalable authentication with non-repudiation and public verifiability, which are necessary for auditing and dispute resolution in such IoT applications. However, digital signatures have been shown to be highly costly for low-end IoT devices, especially when embedded devices (e.g., medical implants) must operate without a battery replacement for a long time.   We propose an Energy-aware Signature for Embedded Medical devices (ESEM) that achieves near-optimal signer efficiency. ESEM signature generation does not require any costly operations (e.g., elliptic curve (EC) scalar multiplication/addition), but only a small constant-number of pseudo-random function calls, additions, and a single modular multiplication. ESEM has the smallest signature size among its EC-based counterparts with an identical private key size. We achieve this by eliminating the use of the ephemeral public key (i.e, commitment) in Schnorr-type signatures from the signing via a distributed construction at the verifier without interaction with the signer while permitting a constant-size public key. We proved that ESEM is secure (in random oracle model), and fully implemented it on an 8-bit AVR microcontroller that is commonly used in medical devices. Our experiments showed that ESEM achieves 8.4x higher energy efficiency over its closest counterpart while offering a smaller signature and code size. Hence, ESEM can be suitable for deployment on resource limited embedded devices in IoT. We open-sourced our software for public testing and wide-adoption.",

      "abstract": "The increasing integration of modern IT technologies into OT technologies and industrial systems is expanding the vulnerability surface of legacy infrastructures, which often rely on outdated protocols and resource-constrained devices. Recent security incidents in safety-critical industries exposed how the lack of proper message authentication enables attackers to inject malicious commands or alter system behavior, revealing fundamental security weaknesses in existing architectures. These shortcomings have thus prompted new regulations that emphasize the pressing need to strengthen cybersecurity, particularly in legacy systems. Authentication is widely recognized as a fundamental security measure that enhances system resilience. However, its adoption in legacy industrial environments is limited due to practical challenges like backward compatibility, message format changes, and hardware replacement or upgrades costs. In this paper, we introduce ACRIC, a message authentication solution to secure legacy industrial communications explicitly tailored to overcome those challenges all at once. ACRIC uniquely leverages cryptographic computations applied to the CRC field - already present in most industrial communication protocols - ensuring robust message integrity protection and authentication without requiring additional hardware or modifications to existing message formats. ACRIC's backward compatibility and protocol-agnostic nature enable coexistence with non-secured devices, thus facilitating gradual security upgrades in legacy infrastructures. Formal security assessment and experimental evaluation on an industrial-grade testbed demonstrate that ACRIC provides robust security guarantees with minimal computational overhead (~ 4 us). These results underscore ACRIC's practicality, cost-effectiveness, and suitability for effective adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.",

We identify this core functionality, and argue for the recognition of efficient and reliable key management support---both within IoT devices, and by a unifying external management platform---as a baseline requirement for an IoT world. We present a framework architecture to facilitate secure, flexible and convenient device management in commodity IoT scenarios, and offer an illustrative set of protocols as a base solution---not to promote specific solution details, but to highlight baseline functionality to help domain owners oversee deployments of large numbers of independent multi-vendor IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "With the rapid development of health equipments, increasingly more patients have installed the implantable medical devices (IMD) in their bodies for diagnostic, monitoring, and therapeutic purposes. IMDs are extremely limited in computation power and battery capacity. Meanwhile, IMDs have to communicate with an external programmer device (i.e., IMD programmer) through the wireless channel, which put them under the risk of unauthorized access and malicious wireless attacks. In this paper, we propose a proxy-based fine-grained access control scheme for IMDs, which can prolong the IMD's lifetime by delegating the access control computations to the proxy device (e.g., smartphone). In our scheme, the proxy communicates with the IMD programmer through an audio cable, which is resistant to a number of wireless attacks. Additionally, we use the ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) to enforce fine-grained access control. The proposed scheme is implemented on real emulator devices and evaluated through experimental tests. The experiments show that the proposed scheme is lightweight and effective.",

      "abstract": "Automated insulin delivery (AID) systems have emerged as a significant technological advancement in diabetes care. These systems integrate a continuous glucose monitor, an insulin pump, and control algorithms to automate insulin delivery, reducing the burden of self-management and offering enhanced glucose control. However, the increasing reliance on wireless connectivity and software control has exposed AID systems to critical security risks that could result in life-threatening treatment errors. This review first presents a comprehensive examination of the security landscape, covering technical vulnerabilities, legal frameworks, and commercial product considerations, and an analysis of existing research on attack vectors, defence mechanisms, as well as evaluation methods and resources for AID systems. Despite recent advancements, several open challenges remain in achieving secure AID systems, particularly in standardising security evaluation frameworks and developing comprehensive, lightweight, and adaptive defence strategies. As one of the most widely adopted and extensively studied physiologic closed-loop control systems, this review serves as a valuable reference for understanding security challenges and solutions applicable to analogous medical systems.",
