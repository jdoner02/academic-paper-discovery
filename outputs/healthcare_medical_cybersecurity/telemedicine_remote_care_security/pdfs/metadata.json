      "abstract": "Wearable devices like smartwatches, wristbands, and fitness trackers are designed to be lightweight devices to be worn on the human body. With the increased connectivity of wearable devices, they will become integral to remote healthcare solutions. For example, a smartwatch can measure and upload a patient's vital signs to the cloud through a network which is monitored by software backed with Artificial Intelligence. When an anomaly of a patient is detected, it will be alerted to healthcare professionals for proper intervention. Remote healthcare offers substantial benefits for both patients and healthcare providers as patients may avoid expensive in-patient care by choosing the comfort of staying at home while being monitored after a surgery and healthcare providers can resolve challenges between limited resources and a growing population.   While remote healthcare through wearable devices is ubiquitous and affordable, it raises concerns about patient privacy. Patients may wonder: Is my data stored in the cloud safe? Can anyone access and manipulate my data for blackmailing? Hence, securing patient private information end-to-end becomes crucial. This paper explores solutions for applying modern cryptography to secure wearable apps and ensure patient data is protected with confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity from wearable edge to cloud.",

This capability could enable the development of reliable digital biomarkers from long-term longitudinal data collected remotely from patients. We built an open-source platform, RADAR-base, to support large-scale data collection in remote monitoring studies. RADAR-base is a modern remote data collection platform built around Confluent's Apache Kafka, to support scalability, extensibility, security, privacy and quality of data. It provides support for study design and set-up, active (eg PROMs) and passive (eg. phone sensors, wearable devices and IoT) remote data collection capabilities with feature generation (eg. behavioural, environmental and physiological markers). The backend enables secure data transmission, and scalable solutions for data storage, management and data access. The platform has successfully collected longitudinal data for various cohorts in a number of disease areas including Multiple Sclerosis, Depression, Epilepsy, ADHD, Alzheimer, Autism and Lung diseases. Digital biomarkers developed through collected data are providing useful insights into different diseases. RADAR-base provides a modern open-source, community-driven solution for remote monitoring, data collection, and digital phenotyping of physical and mental health diseases. Clinicians can use digital biomarkers to augment their decision making for the prevention, personalisation and early intervention of disease.",

      "abstract": "With the ubiquitous advancement in smart medical devices and systems, the potential of Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) network is evolving in modern healthcare systems. The medical professionals (doctors, nurses, or medical experts) can access vitals and sensitive physiological information about the patients and provide proper treatment to improve the quality of life through the RPM network. However, the wireless nature of communication in the RPM network makes it challenging to design an efficient mechanism for secure communication. Many authentication schemes have been proposed in recent years to ensure the security of the RPM network. Pseudonym, digital signature, and Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols are used for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to develop secure authorization and privacy-preserving communication. However, traditional authentication protocols face overhead challenges due to maintaining a large set of key-pairs or pseudonyms results on the hospital cloud server. In this research work, we identify this research gap and propose a novel secure and efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme using cuckoo filters for the RPM network. The use of cuckoo filters in our proposed scheme provides an efficient way for mutual anonymous authentication and a secret shared key establishment process between medical professionals and patients. Moreover, we identify the misbehaving sensor nodes using a correlation-based anomaly detection model to establish secure communication. The security analysis and formal security validation using SPAN and AVISPA tools show the robustness of our proposed scheme against message modification attacks, replay attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.",

      "abstract": "The revolution of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wearable technology has opened up great possibilities in remote patient monitoring. To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting the wearable technology. However, these technologies also pose grave privacy risks and security concerns about the transfer and the logging of data transactions. One solution to protect privacy in healthcare is the use of blockchain technology. However, one of the primary problems with blockchain is its highly limited scalability. In this work here, we propose the utilization of a blockchain based protocol to provide secure management and analysis of data. In this paper we use recently introduced PoW based protocol GHOSTDAG, that generalizes Satoshi's blockchain to a direct acyclic graph of blocks (blockDAG) and provides high throughput while also avoiding the security-scalability problem. We use two blockchains based on the original GHOSTDAG protocol, one that is private and one that is public. Using a private blockchain, we create a system where we use smart contracts to analyze patient health data. If the smart contract for any reason issues an alert for an abnormal reading then the system makes the record of that event to the public blockchain. This would resolve the privacy and security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring and also the limited scalability problem of Satoshi's original blockchain.",

      "abstract": "IoT has enabled the rapid growth of smart remote healthcare applications. These IoT-based remote healthcare applications deliver fast and preventive medical services to patients at risk or with chronic diseases. However, ensuring data security and patient privacy while exchanging sensitive medical data among medical IoT devices is still a significant concern in remote healthcare applications. Altered or corrupted medical data may cause wrong treatment and create grave health issues for patients. Moreover, current remote medical applications' efficiency and response time need to be addressed and improved. Considering the need for secure and efficient patient care, this paper proposes a lightweight Blockchain-based and Fog-enabled remote patient monitoring system that provides a high level of security and efficient response time. Simulation results and security analysis show that the proposed lightweight blockchain architecture fits the resource-constrained IoT devices well and is secure against attacks. Moreover, the augmentation of Fog computing improved the responsiveness of the remote patient monitoring system by 40%.",

      "abstract": "Mobile health applications (mHealth apps for short) are being increasingly adopted in the healthcare sector, enabling stakeholders such as governments, health units, medics, and patients, to utilize health services in a pervasive manner. Despite having several known benefits, mHealth apps entail significant security and privacy challenges that can lead to data breaches with serious social, legal, and financial consequences. This research presents an empirical investigation about security awareness of end-users of mHealth apps that are available on major mobile platforms, including Android and iOS. We collaborated with two mHealth providers in Saudi Arabia to survey 101 end-users, investigating their security awareness about (i) existing and desired security features, (ii) security related issues, and (iii) methods to improve security knowledge. Findings indicate that majority of the end-users are aware of the existing security features provided by the apps (e.g., restricted app permissions); however, they desire usable security (e.g., biometric authentication) and are concerned about privacy of their health information (e.g., data anonymization). End-users suggested that protocols such as session timeout or Two-factor authentication (2FA) positively impact security but compromise usability of the app. Security-awareness via social media, peer guidance, or training from app providers can increase end-users trust in mHealth apps. This research investigates human-centric knowledge based on empirical evidence and provides a set of guidelines to develop secure and usable mHealth apps.",

      "abstract": "The utilization of mHealth applications for remote monitoring has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enhancing patient outcomes, increasing access to healthcare services, and reducing healthcare costs. This literature review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge on mHealth applications for remote monitoring, including their types, benefits, challenges, and limitations, as well as future directions and research gaps. A systematic search of databases such as PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Google Scholar was conducted to identify relevant articles published within the last 5 years. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize the findings. The review highlights various types of mHealth applications used for remote monitoring, such as telemedicine platforms, mobile apps for chronic disease management, and wearable devices. The benefits of these applications include improved patient outcomes, increased access to healthcare, reduced healthcare costs, and addressing healthcare disparities. However, challenges and limitations, such as privacy and security concerns, lack of technical infrastructure, regulatory is-sues, data accuracy, user adherence, and the digital divide, need to be addressed to ensure successful adoption and utilization of mHealth applications. Further research is required in areas such as the long-term effects of mHealth applications on patient outcomes, integration of mHealth data with electronic health records, and the development of artificial intelligence-driven mHealth applica-tions. By harnessing the potential of mHealth applications and addressing the existing challenges, healthcare delivery can be transformed towards a more accessible, cost-effective, and patient-centered model.",

      "abstract": "The growth in Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) services using wearable and non-wearable Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) promises to improve the quality of diagnosis and facilitate timely treatment for a gamut of medical conditions. At the same time, the proliferation of IoMT devices increases the potential for malicious activities that can lead to catastrophic results including theft of personal information, data breach, and compromised medical devices, putting human lives at risk. IoMT devices generate tremendous amount of data that reflect user behavior patterns including both personal and day-to-day social activities along with daily routine health monitoring. In this context, there are possibilities of anomalies generated due to various reasons including unexpected user behavior, faulty sensor, or abnormal values from malicious/compromised devices. To address this problem, there is an imminent need to develop a framework for securing the smart health care infrastructure to identify and mitigate anomalies. In this paper, we present an anomaly detection model for RPM utilizing IoMT and smart home devices. We propose Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based anomaly detection that analyzes normal user behavior in the context of RPM comprising both smart home and smart health devices, and identifies anomalous user behavior. We design a testbed with multiple IoMT devices and home sensors to collect data and use the HMM model to train using network and user behavioral data. Proposed HMM based anomaly detection model achieved over 98% accuracy in identifying the anomalies in the context of RPM.",

In a connected world, hospitals would benefit from providing the on-time availability either for continuous health monitoring or critical services to the citizens in need. In this paper, we propose a secure non-public health enterprise network concept to enable an end-to-end secure and location-agnostic communication between a patient and a healthcare service provider, and other contacts with patients consent either in case of an emergency or to be stored in the medical records. We present how applying non-public enterprise networks can address market demand in health care sector for improved end-to-end security and privacy when dealing with personal and critical information. We present the three tier architecture model describing continuous authentication mechanisms based on biometric collection as well as the dynamic network solutions in the healthcare domain. The biometric collection can be done using ambient or IoT sensors as well as wearable or implantable devices to monitor the patient unobtrusively. Furthermore, end-to-end security solutions should adapt dynamically based on the user profile and situation awareness to address the required level of security at the network side. We discuss the related research challenges for developing the presented non-public health enterprise platform and provide suggestions for future work based on the healthcare sector requirements and opportunities.",

      "abstract": "Mobile applications, mobile apps for short, have proven their usefulness in enhancing service provisioning across a multitude of domains that range from smart healthcare, to mobile commerce, and areas of context sensitive computing. In recent years, a number of empirically grounded, survey-based studies have been conducted to investigate secure development and usage of mHealth apps. However, such studies rely on self reported behaviors documented via interviews or survey questions that lack a practical, i.e. action based approach to monitor and synthesise users actions and behaviors in security critical scenarios. We conducted an empirical study, engaging participants with attack simulation scenarios and analyse their actions, for investigating the security awareness of mHealth app users via action-based research. We simulated some common security attack scenarios in mHealth context and engaged a total of 105 app users to monitor their actions and analyse their behavior. We analysed users data with statistical analysis including reliability and correlations tests, descriptive analysis, and qualitative data analysis. Our results indicate that whilst the minority of our participants perceived access permissions positively, the majority had negative views by indicating that such an app could violate or cost them to lose privacy. Users provide their consent, granting permissions, without a careful review of privacy policies that leads to undesired or malicious access to health critical data. The results also indicated that 73.3% of our participants had denied at least one access permission, and 36% of our participants preferred no authentication method. The study complements existing research on secure usage of mHealth apps, simulates security threats to monitor users actions, and provides empirically grounded guidelines for secure development and usage of mobile health systems.",

      "abstract": "Concerns regarding privacy and data security in conventional healthcare prompted alternative technologies. In smart healthcare, blockchain technology addresses existing concerns with security, privacy, and electronic healthcare transmission. Integration of Blockchain Technology with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows real-time monitoring of protected healthcare data. Utilizing edge devices with IoMT devices is very advantageous for addressing security, computing, and storage challenges. Encryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys is used to conceal sensitive information from unauthorized parties. SHA256 is an algorithm for one-way hashing. It is used to verify that the data has not been altered, since if it had, the hash value would have changed. This article offers a blockchain-based smart healthcare system using IoMT devices for continuous patient monitoring. In addition, it employs edge resources in addition to IoMT devices to have extra computing power and storage to hash and encrypt incoming data before sending it to the blockchain. Symmetric key is utilized to keep the data private even in the blockchain, allowing the patient to safely communicate the data through smart contracts while preventing unauthorized physicians from seeing the data. Through the use of a verification node and blockchain, an asymmetric key is used for the signing and validation of patient data in the healthcare provider system. In addition to other security measures, location-based authentication is recommended to guarantee that data originates from the patient area. Through the edge device, SHA256 is utilized to secure the data's integrity and a secret key is used to maintain its secrecy. The hChain architecture improves the computing power of IoMT environments, the security of EHR sharing through smart contracts, and the privacy and authentication procedures.",

These apps often handle sensitive personal, financial, and health data, making app security a critical concern for developers. While there is extensive research on software security topics like malware and vulnerabilities, less is known about the practical security challenges mobile app developers face and the guidance they seek. In this study, we mine Stack Overflow for questions on mobile app security, which we analyze using quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings reveal that Stack Overflow is a major resource for developers seeking help with mobile app security, especially for Android apps, and identifies seven main categories of security questions: Secured Communications, Database, App Distribution Service, Encryption, Permissions, File-Specific, and General Security. Insights from this research can inform the development of tools, techniques, and resources by the research and vendor community to better support developers in securing their mobile apps.",

Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g/dL and MAE of 1.490 g/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions.",

Additionally, our study aimed to develop a conceptual framework with the challenges faced by mHealth apps development organization for developing secure apps. The knowledge of such challenges can help to reduce the risk of developing insecure mHealth apps. We followed the Systematic Literature Review method for this review. We selected studies that have been published between January 2008 and October 2020. We selected 32 primary studies using predefined criteria and used thematic analysis method for analysing the extracted data. We identified nine challenges that can affect the development of secure mHealth apps. Such as 1) lack of security guidelines and regulations for developing secure mHealth apps, 2) developers lack of knowledge and expertise for secure mHealth app development, 3) lack of stakeholders involvement during mHealth app development, etc . Based on our analysis, we have presented a conceptual framework which highlights the correlation between the identified challenges. We conclude that our findings can help them identify their weaknesses and improve their security practices. Similarly, mHealth apps developers can identify the challenges they face to develop mHealth apps that do not pose security risks for users. Our review is a step towards providing insights into the development of secure mHealth apps.

We proposed a security model that consists of the server and mobile devices in order to realize these security features. In this model we defined the secure communication protocol for the authentication and management of data encryption keys using a private key encryption algorithm with the public key between the server and mobile devices. In addition, we was performed the analysis for the attack to the communication protocol between the mobile device and server. Using the communication protocol, the system will attempt to authenticate the mobile device. The data decrypt key is transmitted only if the authentication process is successful. The data in the mobile device can be decrypted using the key. Our analysis proved that this Protocol ensures anonymity, prevents replay attacks and realizes the interactive identification between the security devices and the authentication server.",

Sensitive topics that may have an impact on a patient's health or even national security include patient health records and information on healthcare providers. Health databases and data sets have been continually breached by many, regular assaults, as well as local and remote servers equipped with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in diverse locations. The problem was addressed by some contemporary strategies that were created to stop these assaults and guarantee the privacy of patient data and information transferred and gathered by sensors. Nevertheless, the literature analysis outlines many indications of weakness that persist in these methods. This study suggests a novel, reliable method that bolsters the information security and data gathered by sensors and kept on base station datasets. The proposed approach combines a number of security mechanisms, including symmetric cryptography for encryption, asymmetric cryptography for access control and signatures, and the Lesamnta-LW method in the signature process. Users' information is shielded from prying eyes by the careful application of these measures and a sound approach. Investigational comparisons, security studies, and thorough results show that the suggested method is better than earlier methods.",

Ubiquitous mobile phones can equip users to supplement psychiatric treatment and manage their mental health. Mobile Mental Health (MMH) apps emerge as an effective alternative to assist with a broad range of psychological disorders filling the much-needed patient-provider accessibility gap. However, it also raises significant concerns with sensitive information leakage.The absence of a transparent privacy policy and lack of user awareness may pose a significant threat to undermining the applicability of such tools. We conducted a multifold study of - 1) Privacy Policies (Manually and with Polisis, an automated framework to evaluate privacy policies); 2) App permissions; 3) Static Analysis for inherent security issues; 4) Dynamic Analysis for threat surface and vulnerabilities detection, and 5) Traffic Analysis.   Our results indicate that apps' exploitable flaws, dangerous permissions, and insecure data handling pose a potential threat to the users' privacy and security. The Dynamic analysis identified 145 vulnerabilities in 20 top-rated MMH apps where attackers and malicious apps can access sensitive information. 45% of MMH apps use a unique identifier, Hardware Id, which can link a unique id to a particular user and probe users' mental health. Traffic analysis shows that sensitive mental health data can be leaked through insecure data transmission. MMH apps need better scrutiny and regulation for more widespread usage to meet the increasing need for mental health care without being intrusive to the already vulnerable population.",

However, as the number of connected medical devices increases, the risk of cyber threats also increases. Wearable medication devices based on IoT attached to patients' bodies are prone to significant cyber threats. Being connected to the Internet exposes these devices to potential harm, which could disrupt or degrade device performance and harm patients. To ensure patient safety and well-being, it is crucial to establish secure data authentication for internet-connected medical devices.

This paper presents an empirical study aimed at exploring the security awareness of end-users of mHealth apps. We collaborated with two mHealth providers in Saudi Arabia to gather data from 101 end-users. The results reveal that despite having the required knowledge, end-users lack appropriate behaviour , i.e., reluctance or lack of understanding to adopt security practices, compromising health-critical data with social, legal, and financial consequences. The results emphasize that mHealth providers should ensure security training of end-users (e.g., threat analysis workshops), promote best practices to enforce security (e.g., multi-step authentication), and adopt suitable mHealth apps (e.g., trade-offs for security vs usability). The study provides empirical evidence and a set of guidelines about security awareness of mHealth apps.",

By leveraging the logistic map as the chaotic function for encryption, our system offers a highly secure framework that dynamically encrypts ECG signals without adding significant latency. To validate the system's reliability, we applied a series of security tests. The results demonstrate that chaotic encryption is effective in enhancing data security, as evidenced by high entropy values and strong key sensitivity, ensuring protection against common cryptographic attacks. Additionally, the system's real time disease detection model, based on deep learning, operates seamlessly with encrypted data, providing accurate diagnosis without compromising security. Our findings indicate that chaotic encryption, paired with real time analysis, is a powerful method for protecting sensitive medical data, making this approach particularly relevant for telemedicine and remote patient monitoring applications. The success of this system highlights its potential for broader application to other biomedical signals, providing a secure infrastructure for the future of digital health.",

It extensively uses sensing technologies (e.g., electronic health monitoring devices), computations (e.g., machine learning), and communication (e.g., interaction between the health data centers). As health data contain sensitive private information, including the identity of patient and carer and medical conditions of the patient, proper care is required at all times. Leakage of these private information affects the personal life, including bullying, high insurance premium, and loss of job due to the medical history. Thus, the security, privacy of and trust on the information are of utmost importance. Moreover, government legislation and ethics committees demand the security and privacy of healthcare data.

In this regard, firstly, this paper explores the regulations, ethical guidelines around the world, and domain-specific needs. Then it presents the requirements and investigates the associated challenges. Secondly, this paper investigates secure and privacy-preserving machine learning methods suitable for the computation of precision health data along with their usage in relevant health projects.

      "abstract": "Mobile applications (apps) have become an essential part of everyday life, offering convenient access to services such as banking, healthcare, and shopping. With these apps handling sensitive personal and financial data, ensuring their security is paramount. While previous research has explored mobile app developer practices, there is limited knowledge about the common practices and challenges that developers face in securing their apps. Our study addresses this need through a global survey of 137 experienced mobile app developers, providing a developer-centric view of mobile app security. Our findings show that developers place high importance on security, frequently implementing features such as authentication and secure storage. They face challenges with managing vulnerabilities, permissions, and privacy concerns, and often rely on resources like Stack Overflow for help. Many developers find that existing learning materials do not adequately prepare them to build secure apps and provide recommendations, such as following best practices and integrating security at the beginning of the development process. We envision our findings leading to improved security practices, better-designed tools and resources, and more effective training programs.",

It is now within the reach of mass people with lots of inexpensive cool features. In this paper we have designed and developed a very low cost, efficient and reliable Digital home system. Fully Controlled Digital Home is no more a Luxury. Our proposed system made it affordable. We built a low-cost feature-rich Digital Home System (DHS). Digital Home System is combination of automated services i.e. Electronic Device Controller, IR Security System, Web Desktop, Remote Video Surveillance System and Virtual Mobile by which we can control our home by avoiding old manual processes e.g. our physical presence at home is optional. The System provides some of the modern luxury & security features to us. Now we can control Light, fan, AC or any electronic devices by voice command, Blue-tooth, GPRS or Website. To control the system remotely, GPRS connectivity is added. We can also monitor our home from remote area by using Remote Video Surveillance System. This enables live video into mobile device of the digital home. Moreover, we can also access our PC and do the necessary tasks from any internet enabled computer in the world by using Web Desktop which is specially built for this purpose. Furthermore, access of unauthorized person in the home will be notified by SMS & store the image of the person and also generate a voice alarm. So that ensures the security of our valuable things. Also we can identify and monitor the location of our valuable assets e.g. precious metals remotely. Finally, Virtual mobile application is a Universal mobile Driver by which we can exactly perform some same task e.g. Remote call, Phone book access, SMS read-write of our mobile device from our new invented computer's virtual mobile.",

The advent of Internet of Things (IOT) have complicated the matters further as organizations are not fully cognizant to the all facets of threats to data privacy. Physicians and health care practitioners need to be made aware of various new avenues of data storage and transmission that need to be secured and controlled. In this paper we look at various threats and challenges that IOT, Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) and Personal Area Networks (PANs) technologies pose to the patients privacy data.

      "abstract": "Remote SIM provisioning (RSP) for consumer devices is the protocol specified by the GSM Association for downloading SIM profiles into a secure element in a mobile device. The process is commonly known as eSIM, and it is expected to replace removable SIM cards. The security of the protocol is critical because the profile includes the credentials with which the mobile device will authenticate to the mobile network. In this paper, we present a formal security analysis of the consumer RSP protocol. We model the multi-party protocol in applied pi calculus, define formal security goals, and verify them in ProVerif. The analysis shows that the consumer RSP protocol protects against a network adversary when all the intended participants are honest. However, we also model the protocol in realistic partial compromise scenarios where the adversary controls a legitimate participant or communication channel. The security failures in the partial compromise scenarios reveal weaknesses in the protocol design. The most important observation is that the security of RSP depends unnecessarily on it being encapsulated in a TLS tunnel. Also, the lack of pre-established identifiers means that a compromised download server anywhere in the world or a compromised secure element can be used for attacks against RSP between honest participants. Additionally, the lack of reliable methods for verifying user intent can lead to serious security failures. Based on the findings, we recommend practical improvements to RSP implementations, future versions of the specification, and mobile operator processes to increase the robustness of eSIM security.",

Wearable BCI setups typically involve a head-mounted sensor connected to a mobile device, combined with ML-based data processing. Consequently, they are susceptible to a multiplicity of attacks across the hardware, software, and networking stacks used that can leak users' brainwave data or at worst relinquish control of BCI-assisted devices to remote attackers. In this paper, we: (i) analyse the whole-system security and privacy threats to existing wearable BCI products from an operating system and adversarial machine learning perspective; and (ii) introduce Argus, the first information flow control system for wearable BCI applications that mitigates these attacks. Argus' domain-specific design leads to a lightweight implementation on Linux ARM platforms suitable for existing BCI use-cases. Our proof of concept attacks on real-world BCI devices (Muse, NeuroSky, and OpenBCI) led us to discover more than 300 vulnerabilities across the stacks of six major attack vectors. Our evaluation shows Argus is highly effective in tracking sensitive dataflows and restricting these attacks with an acceptable memory and performance overhead (<15%).",

The communication is held through internet connectivity, therefore security and privacy are the main motive aspects of a secure cloud-assisted TMIS. However, because very sensitive data is transmitted between patients and doctors through the cloud server, thus security protection is important for this system.

In particular, we suggest a framework based on remote attestation as a proxy to authenticate remote services, where the device is associated to the user and replaces the users credentials. In addition, we use the TPM 2.0 to enable secured information and data storage within the device itself. We present an implementation and performance evaluation of the suggested architecture that uses our novel attestation and authentication scheme and reveal the caveats of using software TPM in todays mobile devices.",

      "abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are generally designed for scenarios in which all data is stored in one data center, where the training is performed. However, in many applications, e.g., in the healthcare domain, the training data is distributed among several entities, e.g., different hospitals or patients' mobile devices/sensors. At the same time, transferring the data to a central location for learning is certainly not an option, due to privacy concerns and legal issues, and in certain cases, because of the communication and computation overheads. Federated Learning (FL) is the state-of-the-art collaborative ML approach for training an ML model across multiple parties holding local data samples, without sharing them. However, enabling learning from distributed data over such edge Internet of Things (IoT) systems (e.g., mobile-health and wearable technologies, involving sensitive personal/medical data) in a privacy-preserving fashion presents a major challenge mainly due to their stringent resource constraints, i.e., limited computing capacity, communication bandwidth, memory storage, and battery lifetime. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving edge FL framework for resource-constrained mobile-health and wearable technologies over the IoT infrastructure. We evaluate our proposed framework extensively and provide the implementation of our technique on Amazon's AWS cloud platform based on the seizure detection application in epilepsy monitoring using wearable technologies.",

IoT-enabled devices are used for in-hospital and in-home patient monitoring to collect and transfer biomedical data pertaining to blood pressure, electrocardiography (ECG), blood sugar levels, body temperature, etc. Among these devices, wearables have found their presence in a wide range of healthcare applications. These devices generate data in real-time and transmit them to nearby gateways and remote servers for processing and visualization. The data transmitted by these devices are vulnerable to a range of adversarial threats, and as such, privacy and integrity need to be preserved. In this paper, we present LightIoT, a lightweight and secure communication approach for data exchanged among the devices of a healthcare infrastructure. LightIoT operates in three phases: initialization, pairing, and authentication. These phases ensure the reliable transmission of data by establishing secure sessions among the communicating entities (wearables, gateways and a remote server). Statistical results exhibit that our scheme is lightweight, robust, and resilient against a wide range of adversarial attacks and incurs much lower computational and communication overhead for the transmitted data in the presence of existing approaches.",

For instance, wearable smart infusion pumps can accurately administer medication and integrate with electronic health records. These pumps can alert healthcare professionals or remote servers when an operation fails, preventing distressing incidents. However, as the number of connected medical devices increases, so does the risk of cyber threats. Wearable medication devices based on IoT attached to patients' bodies are particularly vulnerable to significant cyber threats. Since they are connected to the internet, these devices can be exposed to potential harm, which can disrupt or degrade device performance and harm patients. Therefore, it is crucial to establish secure data authentication for internet-connected medical devices to ensure patient safety and well-being. It is also important to note that the wearability option of such devices might downgrade the computational resources, making them more susceptible to security risks. We propose implementing a security approach for a wearable infusion pump to mitigate cyber threats. We evaluated the proposed architecture with 20, 50, and 100 users for 10 minutes and repeated the evaluation 10 times with two infusion settings, each repeated five times. The desired volumes and rates for the two settings were 2 ml and 4 ml/hr and 5 ml and 5 ml/hr, respectively. The maximum error in infusion rate was measured to be 2.5%. We discuss the practical challenges of implementing such a security-enabled device and suggest initial solutions.",

These gadgets necessitate improved security measures to safeguard sensitive health data while tackling scalability issues in real-time settings. The proposed system, hChain 4.0, employs a permissioned blockchain to provide a secure and scalable data infrastructure designed to fulfill these needs. This stands in contrast to conventional systems, which are vulnerable to security flaws or rely on public blockchains, constrained by scalability and expense. The proposed approach introduces a high-privacy method in which health data are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for time-efficient encryption, combined with Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) to enable secure computations on encrypted data, thereby enhancing privacy. Moreover, it utilizes private channels that enable isolated communication and ledger between stakeholders, ensuring robust privacy while supporting collaborative operations. The proposed framework enables anonymized health data sharing for medical research by pseudonymizing patient identity. Additionally, hChain 4.0 incorporates Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to provide secure electronic health record (EHR) sharing among authorized parties, where ABAC ensures fine-grained permission management vital for multi-organizational healthcare settings.

Chronic respiratory disease is likely to benefit from their inclusion, with 545 million people worldwide recorded to suffer from patients using these devices to track their dosage. At the same time, healthcare providers can improve medication administration and monitor respiratory health (Soriano et al., 2020). While IoT medical devices offer numerous benefits, they also have security vulnerabilities that can expose patient data to cyberattacks. It's crucial to prioritize security measures in developing and deploying IoT medical devices, especially in personalized health monitoring systems for individuals with respiratory conditions. Efforts are underway to assess the security risks associated with intelligent inhalers and respiratory medical devices by understanding usability behavior and technological elements to identify and address vulnerabilities effectively. This work analyses usability behavior and technical vulnerabilities, emphasizing the confidentiality of information gained from Smart Inhalers. It then extrapolates to interrogate potential vulnerabilities with Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs). Our work explores the tensions in device development through the intersection of IoT technology and respiratory health, particularly in the context of intelligent inhalers and other breathing medical devices, calling for integrating robust security measures into the development and deployment of IoT devices to safeguard patient data and ensure the secure functioning of these critical healthcare technologies.",

This exponential use has acted as a catalyst in the recent growth of sophisticated attacks such as the replay, man-in-the-middle, and malicious code modification to slink, leak, tweak or exploit the security-critical information in malevolent activities. Therefore, secure communication and software state assurance (at run-time and boot-time) of the device has emerged as open security problems. Furthermore, these devices need to have an appropriate recovery mechanism to bring them back to the known-good operational state. Previous researchers have demonstrated independent methods for attack detection and safeguard. However, the majority of them lack in providing onboard system recovery and secure communication techniques. To bridge this gap, this manuscript proposes SRACARE- a framework that utilizes the custom lightweight, secure communication protocol that performs remote/local attestation, and secure boot with an onboard resilience recovery mechanism to protect the devices from the above-mentioned attacks. The prototype employs an efficient lightweight, low-power 32-bit RISC-V processor, secure communication protocol, code authentication, and resilience engine running on the Artix 7 Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) board. This work presents the performance evaluation and state-of-the-art comparison results, which shows promising resilience to attacks and demonstrate the novel protection mechanism with onboard recovery. The framework achieves these with only 8 % performance overhead and a very small increase in hardware-software footprint.",

Furthermore, compliance with regulatory laws such as GDPR and HIPAA is often deficient, largely because patients typically are asked to provide general consent for healthcare entities to access their data. Recognizing the limitations of existing systems, we present S3PHER, a novel approach to sharing health data that provides patients with control over who accesses their data, what data is accessed, and when. Our system ensures end to end privacy by integrating a Proxy ReEncryption Scheme with a Searchable Encryption Scheme, utilizing Homomorphic Encryption to enable healthcare practitioners to privately search and access patients' documents. The practicality and benefits of S3PHER are further validated through end to end deployment and use case analyses, with tests on real datasets demonstrating promising execution times.",

      "abstract": "A new development of smart-home systems is to use mobile apps to control IoT devices across a Home Area Network (HAN). Those systems tend to rely on the Wi-Fi router to authenticate other devices; as verified in our study, IoT vendors tend to trust all devices connected to the HAN. This treatment exposes them to the attack from malicious apps, particularly those running on authorized phones, which the router does not have information to control, as confirmed in our measurement study. Mitigating this threat cannot solely rely on IoT manufacturers, which may need to change the hardware on the devices to support encryption, increasing the cost of the device, or software developers who we need to trust to implement security correctly.   In this work, we present a new technique to control the communication between the IoT devices and their apps in a unified, backward-compatible way. Our approach, called Hanguard, does not require any changes to the IoT devices themselves, the IoT apps or the OS of the participating phones. Hanguard achieves a fine-grained, per-app protection through bridging the OS-level situation awareness and the router-level per-flow control: each phone runs a non-system userspace Monitor app to identify the party that attempts to access the protected IoT device and inform the router through a control plane of its access decision; the router enforces the decision on the data plane after verifying whether the phone should be allowed to talk to the device. Hanguard uses a role-based access control (RBAC) schema which leverages type enforcement (TE) and multi-category security (MCS) primitives to define highly flexible access control rules. We implemented our design over both Android and iOS (>95% of mobile OS market share) and a popular router. Our study shows that Hanguard is both efficient and effective in practice.",

      "abstract": "A cyber-physical system is considered to be a collection of strongly coupled communication systems and devices that poses numerous security trials in various industrial applications including healthcare. The security and privacy of patient data is still a big concern because healthcare data is sensitive and valuable, and it is most targeted over the internet. Moreover, from the industrial perspective, the cyber-physical system plays a crucial role in the exchange of data remotely using sensor nodes in distributed environments. In the healthcare industry, Blockchain technology offers a promising solution to resolve most securities-related issues due to its decentralized, immutability, and transparency properties. In this paper, a blockchain-inspired secure and reliable data exchange architecture is proposed in the cyber-physical healthcare industry 4.0. The proposed system uses the BigchainDB, Tendermint, Inter-Planetary-File-System (IPFS), MongoDB, and AES encryption algorithms to improve Healthcare 4.0. Furthermore, blockchain-enabled secure healthcare architecture for accessing and managing the records between Doctors and Patients is introduced. The development of a blockchain-based Electronic Healthcare Record (EHR) exchange system is purely patient-centric, which means the entire control of data is in the owner's hand which is backed by blockchain for security and privacy. Our experimental results reveal that the proposed architecture is robust to handle more security attacks and can recover the data if 2/3 of nodes are failed. The proposed model is patient-centric, and control of data is in the patient's hand to enhance security and privacy, even system administrators can't access data without user permission.",

      "abstract": "Due to increased security awareness of enterprises for mobile applications operating with sensitive or personal data as well as extended regulations form legislative (the principle of proportionality) various approaches, how to implement (extended) two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication or virtual private network within enterprise mobile environments to ensure delivery of secure applications, have been developed. Within mobile applications it will not be sufficient to rely on security measures of the individual components or interested parties, an overall concept of a security solution has to be established which requires the interaction of several technologies, standards and system components. These include the physical fuses on the device itself as well as on the network layer (such as integrated security components), security measures (such as employee agreements, contract clauses), insurance coverage, but also software technical protection at the application level (e.g. password protection, encryption, secure container). The purpose of this paper is to summarize the challenges and practical successes, providing best practices to fulfill appropriate risk coverage of mobile applications. I present a use case, in order to proof the concept in actual work settings, and to demonstrate the adaptability of the approach.",

      "abstract": "Secure and privacy-preserving management of Personal Health Records (PHRs) has proved to be a major challenge in modern healthcare. Current solutions generally do not offer patients a choice in where the data is actually stored and also rely on at least one fully trusted element that patients must also trust with their data. In this work, we present the Health Access Broker (HAB), a patient-controlled service for secure PHR sharing that (a) does not impose a specific storage location (uniquely for a PHR system), and (b) does not assume any of its components to be fully secure against adversarial threats. Instead, HAB introduces a novel auditing and intrusion-detection mechanism where its workflow is securely logged and continuously inspected to provide auditability of data access and quickly detect any intrusions.",
