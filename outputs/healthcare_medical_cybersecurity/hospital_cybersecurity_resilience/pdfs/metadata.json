      "abstract": "The increasing importance of data in the healthcare sector has led to a rise in cybercrime targeting patient information. Data breaches pose significant financial and reputational risks to many healthcare organizations including clinics and hospitals. This study aims to propose the ideal approach to developing a defense system that ensures that patient data is protected from the insidious acts of healthcare data threat actors. Using a gradientboosting classifier machine learning model, the study predicts the severity of healthcare data breaches. Secondary data was collected from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Portal with key indicators. Also, the study gathers key cyber-security data from Kaggle, which was utilized for the study. The findings revealed that hacking and IT incidents are the most common type of breaches in the healthcare industry, with network servers being targeted in most cases. The model evaluation showed that the gradient boosting algorithm performs well. Therefore, the study recommends that organizations implement comprehensive security protocols, particularly focusing on robust network security to protect servers",

Having an Information Assurance (IA) programallows for the protection of information and information systems and ensures the organization is in compliance with all requires regulations, laws and directive is essential. While most organizations have such a policy in place, often it is inadequate to ensure the proper protection to prevent security breaches. The increase of data breaches in the last few years demonstrates the importance of an effective IA program. To ensure an effective IA policy, the policy must manage the operational risk, including identifying risks, assessment and mitigation of identified risks and ongoing monitoring to ensure compliance",

Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks present significant dangers, jeopardizing operational stability and patient safety. This study introduces CryptoDNA, an innovative machine learning detection framework influenced by cryptojacking detection methods, designed to identify and alleviate DDoS attacks in healthcare IoT settings. The proposed approach relies on behavioral analytics, including atypical resource usage and network activity patterns. Key features derived from cryptojacking-inspired methodologies include entropy-based analysis of traffic, time-series monitoring of device performance, and dynamic anomaly detection. A lightweight architecture ensures inter-compatibility with resource-constrained IoT devices while maintaining high detection accuracy. The proposed architecture and model were tested in real-world and synthetic datasets to demonstrate the model's superior performance, achieving over 96% accuracy with minimal computational overhead. Comparative analysis reveals its resilience against emerging attack vectors and scalability across diverse device ecosystems. By bridging principles from cryptojacking and DDoS detection, CryptoDNA offers a robust, innovative solution to fortify the healthcare IoT landscape against evolving cyber threats and highlights the potential of interdisciplinary approaches in adaptive cybersecurity defense mechanisms for critical healthcare infrastructures.",

      "abstract": "Motivated by reasons such as altruism, managers from different hospitals may engage in cooperative behaviours, which shape the networked healthcare economy. In this paper we study the determinants of hospital cooperation and its association with the quality delivered by hospitals, using Italian administrative data. We explore the impact on patient transfers between hospitals (cooperation/network) of a set of demand-supply factors, as well as distance-based centrality measures. We then use this framework to assess how such cooperation is related to the overall quality for the hospital of origin and of destination of the patient transfer. The over-dispersed Poisson mixed model that we propose, inspired by the literature on social relations models, is suitably defined to handle network data, which are rarely used in health economics. The results show that distance plays an important role in hospital cooperation, though there are other factors that matter such as geographical centrality. Another empirical finding is the existence of a positive relationship between hospital cooperation and the overall quality of the connected hospitals. The absence of a source of information on the quality of hospitals accessible to all providers, such as in the form of star ratings, may prevent some hospitals to engage and cooperate with other hospitals of potentially higher quality. This may result in a lower degree of cooperation among hospitals and a reduction in quality overall.",

      "abstract": "Legacy Electronic Health Records (EHRs) systems were not developed with the level of connectivity expected from them nowadays. Therefore, interoperability weakness inherent in the legacy systems can result in poor patient care and waste of financial resources. Large hospitals are less likely to share their data with external hospitals due to economic and political reasons. Motivated by these facts, we aim to provide a set of software implementation guidelines, i.e., MedShare to deal with interoperability issues among disconnected healthcare systems. The proposed integrated architecture includes: 1) a data extractor to fetch legacy medical data from a hemodialysis center, 2) converting it to a common data model, 3) indexing patient information using the HashMap technique, and 4) a set of services and tools that can be installed as a coherent environment on top of stand-alone EHRs systems. Our work enabled three cooperating but autonomous hospitals to mutually exchange medical data and helped them develop a common reference architecture. It lets stakeholders retain control over their patient data, winning the trust and confidence much needed towards a successful deployment of MedShare. Security concerns were effectively addressed that also included patient consent in the data exchange process. Thereby, the implemented toolset offered a collaborative environment to share EHRs by the healthcare providers.",

      "abstract": "The Healthcare Internet-of-Things (H-IoT), commonly known as Digital Healthcare, is a data-driven infrastructure that highly relies on smart sensing devices (i.e., blood pressure monitors, temperature sensors, etc.) for faster response time, treatments, and diagnosis. However, with the evolving cyber threat landscape, IoT devices have become more vulnerable to the broader risk surface (e.g., risks associated with generative AI, 5G-IoT, etc.), which, if exploited, may lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and lack of command and control and potential harm. This paper reviews the fundamentals of healthcare IoT, its privacy, and data security challenges associated with machine learning and H-IoT devices. The paper further emphasizes the importance of monitoring healthcare IoT layers such as perception, network, cloud, and application. Detecting and responding to anomalies involves various cyber-attacks and protocols such as Wi-Fi 6, Narrowband Internet of Things (NB-IoT), Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, and 5G New Radio (5G NR). A robust authentication mechanism based on machine learning and deep learning techniques is required to protect and mitigate H-IoT devices from increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities. Hence, in this review paper, security and privacy challenges and risk mitigation strategies for building resilience in H-IoT are explored and reported.",

      "abstract": "Digital healthcare is essential to facilitate consumers to access and disseminate their medical data easily for enhanced medical care services. However, the significant concern with digitalization across healthcare systems necessitates for a prompt, productive, and secure storage facility along with a vigorous communication strategy, to stimulate sensitive digital healthcare data sharing and proactive estimation of malicious entities. In this context, this paper introduces a comprehensive quantum-based framework to overwhelm the potential security and privacy issues for secure healthcare data management. It equips quantum encryption for the secured storage and dispersal of healthcare data over the shared cloud platform by employing quantum encryption. Also, the framework furnishes a quantum feed-forward neural network unit to examine the intention behind the data request before granting access, for proactive estimation of potential data breach. In this way, the proposed framework delivers overall healthcare data management by coupling the advanced and more competent quantum approach with machine learning to safeguard the data storage, access, and prediction of malicious entities in an automated manner. Thus, the proposed IQ-HDM leads to more cooperative and effective healthcare delivery and empowers individuals with adequate custody of their health data. The experimental evaluation and comparison of the proposed IQ-HDM framework with state-of-the-art methods outline a considerable improvement up to 67.6%, in tackling cyber threats related to healthcare data security.",

Blockchains have been proposed as a promising solution for supporting Electronic Health Records (EHRs), but have also been linked to scalability concerns about supporting real-world healthcare systems. This paper quantifies the scalability issues and bottlenecks related to current blockchains and puts into perspective the limitations blockchains have with supporting healthcare systems. Particularly we show that well known blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and IOTA cannot support transactions of a large scale hospital system such as the University of Kentucky HealthCare system and leave over 7.5M unsealed transactions per day. We then discuss how bottlenecks of blockchains can be relieved with sidechains, enabling well-known blockchains to support even larger hospital systems of over 30M transactions per day. We then introduce the Patient-Healthchain architecture to provide future direction on how scaling blockchains for EHR systems with sidechains can be achieved.",

Technologies such as the medical internet of things and wearable devices are generating a plethora of data available on the cloud anytime from anywhere. This data can be analyzed using advanced artificial intelligence techniques for diagnosis, prognosis, or even treatment of disease. This advancement comes with a major risk to protecting and securing protected health information (PHI). The prevailing regulations for preserving PHI are neither comprehensive nor easy to implement. The study first identifies twenty activities crucial for privacy and security, then categorizes them into five homogeneous categories namely: $\\complement_1$ (Policy and Compliance Management), $\\complement_2$ (Employee Training and Awareness), $\\complement_3$ (Data Protection and Privacy Control), $\\complement_4$ (Monitoring and Response), and $\\complement_5$ (Technology and Infrastructure Security) and prioritizes these categories to provide a framework for the implementation of privacy and security in a wise manner. The framework utilized the Delphi Method to identify activities, criteria for categorization, and prioritization. Categorization is based on the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN), and prioritization is performed using a Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The outcomes conclude that $\\complement_3$ activities should be given first preference in implementation and followed by $\\complement_1$ and $\\complement_2$ activities. Finally, $\\complement_4$ and $\\complement_5$ should be implemented. The prioritized view of identified clustered healthcare activities related to security and privacy, are useful for healthcare policymakers and healthcare informatics professionals.",

Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted broad interests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and privacy concerns remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for information sharing in the healthcare sector from business operation to research collaboration. This paper focuses on the security and privacy requirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements, accompanied by technical solution techniques and strategies. First, we discuss the security and privacy requirements and attributes required for electronic medical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second, we categorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for electronic medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing these security and privacy properties in the three categories of usage scenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous signatures, attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for smart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain application scenarios in healthcare sector. We conjecture that this survey will help healthcare professionals, decision makers, and healthcare service developers to gain technical and intuitive insights into the security and privacy of healthcare blockchains in terms of concepts, risks, requirements, development and deployment technologies and systems.",

      "abstract": "Advancements in healthcare industry with new technology and population growth has given rise to security threat to our most personal data. The healthcare data management system consists of records in different formats such as text, numeric, pictures and videos leading to data which is big and unstructured. Also, hospitals have several branches at different locations throughout a country and overseas. In view of these requirements a cloud based healthcare management system can be an effective solution for efficient health care data management. One of the major concerns of a cloud based healthcare system is the security aspect. It includes theft to identity, tax fraudulence, insurance frauds, medical frauds and defamation of high profile patients. Hence, a secure data access and retrieval is needed in order to provide security of critical medical records in health care management system. Biometric authentication mechanism is suitable in this scenario since it overcomes the limitations of token theft and forgetting passwords in conventional token id-password mechanism used for providing security. It also has high accuracy rate for secure data access and retrieval. In this paper we propose BAMHealthCloud which is a cloud based system for management of healthcare data, it ensures security of data through biometric authentication. It has been developed after performing a detailed case study on healthcare sector in a developing country. Training of the signature samples for authentication purpose has been performed in parallel on hadoop MapReduce framework using Resilient Backpropagation neural network. From rigorous experiments it can be concluded that it achieves a speedup of 9x, Equal error rate (EER) of 0.12, sensitivity of 0.98 and specificity of 0.95 as compared to other approaches existing in literature.",

      "abstract": "The growing utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, including smartwatches and wearable medical devices, has facilitated real-time health monitoring and data analysis to enhance healthcare outcomes. These gadgets necessitate improved security measures to safeguard sensitive health data while tackling scalability issues in real-time settings. The proposed system, hChain 4.0, employs a permissioned blockchain to provide a secure and scalable data infrastructure designed to fulfill these needs. This stands in contrast to conventional systems, which are vulnerable to security flaws or rely on public blockchains, constrained by scalability and expense. The proposed approach introduces a high-privacy method in which health data are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for time-efficient encryption, combined with Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) to enable secure computations on encrypted data, thereby enhancing privacy. Moreover, it utilizes private channels that enable isolated communication and ledger between stakeholders, ensuring robust privacy while supporting collaborative operations. The proposed framework enables anonymized health data sharing for medical research by pseudonymizing patient identity. Additionally, hChain 4.0 incorporates Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to provide secure electronic health record (EHR) sharing among authorized parties, where ABAC ensures fine-grained permission management vital for multi-organizational healthcare settings. Experimental assessments indicate that the proposed approach achieves higher scalability, cost-effectiveness, and validated security.",

      "abstract": "As hospitals move towards automating and integrating their computing systems, more fine-grained hospital operations data are becoming available. These data include hospital architectural drawings, logs of interactions between patients and healthcare professionals, prescription data, procedures data, and data on patient admission, discharge, and transfers. This has opened up many fascinating avenues for healthcare-related prediction tasks for improving patient care. However, in order to leverage off-the-shelf machine learning software for these tasks, one needs to learn structured representations of entities involved from heterogeneous, dynamic data streams. Here, we propose DECENT, an auto-encoding heterogeneous co-evolving dynamic neural network, for learning heterogeneous dynamic embeddings of patients, doctors, rooms, and medications from diverse data streams. These embeddings capture similarities among doctors, rooms, patients, and medications based on static attributes and dynamic interactions. DECENT enables several applications in healthcare prediction, such as predicting mortality risk and case severity of patients, adverse events (e.g., transfer back into an intensive care unit), and future healthcare-associated infections. The results of using the learned patient embeddings in predictive modeling show that DECENT has a gain of up to 48.1% on the mortality risk prediction task, 12.6% on the case severity prediction task, 6.4% on the medical intensive care unit transfer task, and 3.8% on the Clostridioides difficile (C.diff) Infection (CDI) prediction task over the state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, case studies on the learned doctor, medication, and room embeddings show that our approach learns meaningful and interpretable embeddings.",

      "abstract": "The application of blockchain technology can be beneficial in the field of healthcare as well as in the fight against the COVID-19 epidemic. In this work, the importance of blockchain is analyzed and it is observed that blockchain technology and the processes associated with it will be utilised in the healthcare systems of the future for data acquisition from sensors, automatic patient monitoring, and secure data storage. This technology substantially simplifies the process of carrying out operations because it can store a substantial quantity of data in a dispersed and secure manner, as well as enable access whenever and wherever it is required to do so. With the assistance of quantum blockchain, the benefits of quantum computing, such as the capability to acquire thermal imaging based on quantum computing and the speed with which patients may be located and monitored, can all be exploited to their full potential. Quantum blockchain is another tool that can be utilised to maintain the confidentiality, authenticity, and accessibility of data records. The processing of medical records could potentially benefit from greater speed and privacy if it combines quantum computing and blockchain technology. The authors of this paper investigate the possible benefits and applications of blockchain and quantum technologies in the field of medicine, pharmacy and healthcare systems. In this context, this work explored and compared quantum technologies and blockchain-based technologies in conjunction with other cutting-edge information and communications technologies such as ratification intelligence, machine learning, drones, and so on.",

      "abstract": "Technology has evolved over the years, making our lives easier. It has impacted the healthcare sector, increasing the average life expectancy of human beings. Still, there are gaps that remain unaddressed. There is a lack of transparency in the healthcare system, which results in inherent trust problems between patients and hospitals. In the present day, a patient does not know whether he or she will get the proper treatment from the hospital for the fee charged. A patient can claim reimbursement of the medical bill from any insurance company. However, today there is minimal scope for the Insurance Company to verify the validity of such bills or medical records. A patient can provide fake details to get financial benefits from the insurance company. Again, there are trust issues between the patient (i.e., the insurance claimer) and the insurance company. Blockchain integrated with the smart contract is a well-known disruptive technology that builds trust by providing transparency to the system. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-enabled Secure and Smart HealthCare System. Fairness of all the entities: patient, hospital, or insurance company involved in the system is guaranteed with no one trusting each other. Privacy and security of patients' medical data are ensured as well. We also propose a method for privacy-preserving sharing of aggregated data with the research community for their own purpose. Shared data must not be personally identifiable, i.e, no one can link the acquired data to the identity of any patient or their medical history. We have implemented the prototype in the Ethereum platform and Ropsten test network, and have included the analysis as well.",

      "abstract": "Healthcare systems are challenged to deliver high-quality and efficient care. Studying patient flow in a hospital is particularly fundamental as it demonstrates effectiveness and efficiency of a hospital. Since hospital is a collection of physically nearby services under one administration, its performance and outcome are shaped by the interaction of its discrete components. Coordination of processes at different levels of organizational structure of a hospital can be studied using network analysis. Hence, this article presents a data-driven static and temporal network of departments. Both networks are directed and weighted and constructed using seven years' (2010-2016) empirical data of 24902 Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) patients. The ties reflect an episode-based transfer of ACS patients from department to department in a hospital. The weight represents the number of patients transferred among departments. As a result, the underlying structure of a network of departments that deliver healthcare for ACS patients is described, the main departments and their role in the diagnosis and treatment process of ACS patients are identified, the role of departments over seven years is analyzed and communities of departments are discovered. The results of this study may help hospital administration to effectively organize and manage the coordination of departments based on their significance, strategic positioning and role in the diagnosis and treatment process which, in turn, nurtures value-based and precision healthcare.",
