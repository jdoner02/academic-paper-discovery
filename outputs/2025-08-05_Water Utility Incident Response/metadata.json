      "abstract": "This research focused on enhancing post-incident malware forensic investigation using reinforcement learning RL. We proposed an advanced MDP post incident malware forensics investigation model and framework to expedite post incident forensics. We then implement our RL Malware Investigation Model based on structured MDP within the proposed framework. To identify malware artefacts, the RL agent acquires and examines forensics evidence files, iteratively improving its capabilities using Q Table and temporal difference learning. The Q learning algorithm significantly improved the agent ability to identify malware. An epsilon greedy exploration strategy and Q learning updates enabled efficient learning and decision making. Our experimental testing revealed that optimal learning rates depend on the MDP environment complexity, with simpler environments benefiting from higher rates for quicker convergence and complex ones requiring lower rates for stability. Our model performance in identifying and classifying malware reduced malware analysis time compared to human experts, demonstrating robustness and adaptability. The study highlighted the significance of hyper parameter tuning and suggested adaptive strategies for complex environments. Our RL based approach produced promising results and is validated as an alternative to traditional methods notably by offering continuous learning and adaptation to new and evolving malware threats which ultimately enhance the post incident forensics investigations.",

      "abstract": "As digital technologies become more pervasive in society and the economy, cybersecurity incidents become more frequent and impactful. According to the NIS and NIS2 Directives, EU Member States and their Operators of Essential Services must establish a minimum baseline set of cybersecurity capabilities and engage in cross-border coordination and cooperation. However, this is only a small step towards European cyber resilience. In this landscape, preparedness, shared situational awareness, and coordinated incident response are essential for effective cyber crisis management and resilience. Motivated by the above, this paper presents PHOENI2X, an EU-funded project aiming to design, develop, and deliver a Cyber Resilience Framework providing Artificial-Intelligence-assisted orchestration, automation and response capabilities for business continuity and recovery, incident response, and information exchange, tailored to the needs of Operators of Essential Services and the EU Member State authorities entrusted with cybersecurity.",

      "abstract": "Incident management is a classical topic in cyber security. Recently, the European Union (EU) has started to consider also the relation between cyber security incidents and cyber security crises. These considerations and preparations, including those specified in the EU's new cyber security laws, constitute the paper's topic. According to an analysis of the laws and associated policy documents, (i) cyber security crises are equated in the EU to large-scale cyber security incidents that either exceed a handling capacity of a single member state or affect at least two member states. For this and other purposes, (ii) the new laws substantially increase mandatory reporting about cyber security incidents, including but not limited to the large-scale incidents. Despite the laws and new governance bodies established by them, however, (iii) the working of actual cyber security crisis management remains unclear particularly at the EU-level. With these policy research results, the paper advances the domain of cyber security incident management research by elaborating how European law perceives cyber security crises and their relation to cyber security incidents, paving the way for many relevant further research topics with practical relevance, whether theoretical, conceptual, or empirical.",

      "abstract": "In the dynamic landscape of digital forensics, the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) stands as a transformative technology, poised to amplify the efficiency and precision of digital forensics investigations. However, the use of ML and AI in digital forensics is still in its nascent stages. As a result, this paper gives a thorough and in-depth analysis that goes beyond a simple survey and review. The goal is to look closely at how AI and ML techniques are used in digital forensics and incident response. This research explores cutting-edge research initiatives that cross domains such as data collection and recovery, the intricate reconstruction of cybercrime timelines, robust big data analysis, pattern recognition, safeguarding the chain of custody, and orchestrating responsive strategies to hacking incidents. This endeavour digs far beneath the surface to unearth the intricate ways AI-driven methodologies are shaping these crucial facets of digital forensics practice. While the promise of AI in digital forensics is evident, the challenges arising from increasing database sizes and evolving criminal tactics necessitate ongoing collaborative research and refinement within the digital forensics profession. This study examines the contributions, limitations, and gaps in the existing research, shedding light on the potential and limitations of AI and ML techniques. By exploring these different research areas, we highlight the critical need for strategic planning, continual research, and development to unlock AI's full potential in digital forensics and incident response. Ultimately, this paper underscores the significance of AI and ML integration in digital forensics, offering insights into their benefits, drawbacks, and broader implications for tackling modern cyber threats.",

      "abstract": "A major cyber security incident can represent a cyber crisis for an organisation, in particular because of the associated risk of substantial reputational damage. As the likelihood of falling victim to a cyberattack has increased over time, so too has the need to understand exactly what is effective corporate communication after an attack, and how best to engage the concerns of customers, partners and other stakeholders. This research seeks to tackle this problem through a critical, multi-faceted investigation into the efficacy of crisis communication and public relations following a data breach. It does so by drawing on academic literature, obtained through a systematic literature review, and real-world case studies. Qualitative data analysis is used to interpret and structure the results, allowing for the development of a new, comprehensive framework for corporate communication to support companies in their preparation and response to such events. The validity of this framework is demonstrated by its evaluation through interviews with senior industry professionals, as well as a critical assessment against relevant practice and research. The framework is further refined based on these evaluations, and an updated version defined. This research represents the first grounded, comprehensive and evaluated proposal for characterising effective corporate communication after cyber security incidents.",

      "abstract": "This Research proposes a Novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) model to optimise malware forensics investigation during cyber incident response. It aims to improve forensic investigation efficiency by reducing false negatives and adapting current practices to evolving malware signatures. The proposed RL framework leverages techniques such as Q-learning and the Markov Decision Process (MDP) to train the system to identify malware patterns in live memory dumps, thereby automating forensic tasks. The RL model is based on a detailed malware workflow diagram that guides the analysis of malware artefacts using static and behavioural techniques as well as machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, it seeks to address challenges in the UK justice system by ensuring the accuracy of forensic evidence. We conduct testing and evaluation in controlled environments, using datasets created with Windows operating systems to simulate malware infections. The experimental results demonstrate that RL improves malware detection rates compared to conventional methods, with the RL model's performance varying depending on the complexity and learning rate of the environment. The study concludes that while RL offers promising potential for automating malware forensics, its efficacy across diverse malware types requires ongoing refinement of reward systems and feature extraction methods.",

      "abstract": "Data breaches refer to unauthorized accesses to data. Typically but not always, data breaches are about cyber crime. An organization facing such a crime is often also in a crisis situation. Therefore, organizations should prepare also for data breaches in their crisis management procedures. These procedures should include also crisis communication plans. To this end, this paper examines data breach crisis communication strategies and their practical executions. The background comes from the vibrant crisis communication research domain. According to a few qualitative case studies from Finland, the conventional wisdom holds well; the successful cases indicate communicating early, taking responsibility, offering an apology, and notifying public authorities. The unsuccessful cases show varying degrees of the reverse, including shifting of blame, positioning of an organization as a victim, and failing to notify public authorities. With these qualitative insights, the paper contributes to the research domain by focusing specifically on data breach crises, their peculiarities, and their management, including with respect to European regulations that have been neglected in existing crisis communication research.",

      "abstract": "Crisis management (CM) for critical infrastructures, natural disasters such as wildfires and hurricanes, terrorist actions, or civil unrest requires high speed communications and connectivity, and access to high performance computational resources to deliver timely dynamic responses to the crisis being managed by different first responders. CM systems should detect, recognize, and disseminate huge amounts of heterogeneous dynamic events that operate at different speeds and formats. Furthermore, the processing of crisis events and the development of real-time responses are major research challenges when the communications and computational resources needed by CM stakeholders are not available or severely degraded by the crisis. The main goal of the research presented in this paper is to utilize Unmanned Autonomous Systems (UAS) to provide Aerial-based Crisis Management Center (ACMC) that will provide the required communications services and the computational resources that are critically needed by first responders. In our approach to develop an ACMC architecture, we utilize a set of flexible Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) that can be dynamically composed to meet the communications and computational requirements of CM tasks. The ACMC services will be modeled as a deep neural network (DNN) mass transport approach to cover a distributed target in a decentralized manner. This is indeed a new decentralized coverage approach with time-varying communication weights. Furthermore, our analysis proves the stability and convergence of the proposed DNN-based mass transport for a team of UAS (e.g., quadcopters), where each quadcopter uses a feedback nonlinear control to independently attain the intended coverage trajectory in a decentralized manner.",
