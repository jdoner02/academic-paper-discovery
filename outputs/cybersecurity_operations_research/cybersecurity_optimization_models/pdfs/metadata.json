      "abstract": "When undertaking cyber security risk assessments, we must assign numeric values to metrics to compute the final expected loss that represents the risk that an organization is exposed to due to cyber threats. Even if risk assessment is motivated from real-world observations and data, there is always a high chance of assigning inaccurate values due to different uncertainties involved (e.g., evolving threat landscape, human errors) and the natural difficulty of quantifying risk per se. Our previous work has proposed a model and a software tool that empowers organizations to compute optimal cyber security strategies given their financial constraints, i.e., available cyber security budget. We have also introduced a general game-theoretic model with uncertain payoffs (probability-distribution-valued payoffs) showing that such uncertainty can be incorporated in the game-theoretic model by allowing payoffs to be random. In this paper, we combine our aforesaid works and we conclude that although uncertainties in cyber security risk assessment lead, on average, to different cyber security strategies, they do not play significant role into the final expected loss of the organization when using our model and methodology to derive this strategies. We show that our tool is capable of providing effective decision support. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that investigates how uncertainties on various parameters affect cyber security investments.",

      "abstract": "The abundance of cyber-physical components in modern day power grid with their diverse hardware and software vulnerabilities has made it difficult to protect them from advanced persistent threats (APTs). An attack graph depicting the propagation of potential cyber-attack sequences from the initial access point to the end objective is vital to identify critical weaknesses of any cyber-physical system. A cyber security personnel can accordingly plan preventive mitigation measures for the identified weaknesses addressing the cyber-attack sequences. However, limitations on available cybersecurity budget restrict the choice of mitigation measures. We address this aspect through our framework, which solves the following problem: given potential cyber-attack sequences for a cyber-physical component in the power grid, find the optimal manner to allocate an available budget to implement necessary preventive mitigation measures. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to identify the optimal budget partition and set of mitigation measures which minimize the vulnerability of cyber-physical components to potential attack sequences. We assume that the allocation of budget affects the efficacy of the mitigation measures. We show how altering the budget allocation for tasks such as asset management, cybersecurity infrastructure improvement, incident response planning and employee training affects the choice of the optimal set of preventive mitigation measures and modifies the associated cybersecurity risk. The proposed framework can be used by cyber policymakers and system owners to allocate optimal budgets for various tasks required to improve the overall security of a cyber-physical system.",

However, these are interlinked since insurance premiums could be reduced by investing more in cybersecurity controls. The expected utility theory and the prospect theory are two alternative theories explaining decision-making under risk and uncertainty, which can inform strategies for optimizing resource allocation. While the former is considered a rational approach, research has shown that most people make decisions consistent with the latter, including on insurance uptakes. We compare and contrast these two approaches to provide important insights into how the two approaches could lead to different optimal allocations resulting in differing risk exposure as well as financial costs. We introduce the concept of a risk curve and show that identifying the nature of the risk curve is a key step in deriving the optimal resource allocation.",

      "abstract": "Homeland security in the United States faces a daunting task due to the multiple threats and hazards that can occur. Natural disasters, human-caused incidents such as terrorist attacks, and technological failures can result in significant damage, fatalities, injuries, and economic losses. The increasing frequency and severity of disruptive events in the United States highlight the urgent need for effectively allocating resources in homeland security and emergency preparedness. This article presents an optimization-based decision support model to help homeland security policymakers identify and select projects that best mitigate the risk of threats and hazards while satisfying a budget constraint. The model incorporates multiple hazards, probabilistic risk assessments, and multidimensional consequences and integrates historical data and publicly available sources to evaluate and select the most effective risk mitigation projects and optimize resource allocation across various disaster scenarios. We apply this model to the state of Iowa, considering 16 hazards, six types of consequences, and 52 mitigation projects. Our results demonstrate how different budget levels influence project selection, emphasizing cost-effective solutions that maximize risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis examines the robustness of project selection under varying effectiveness assumptions and consequence estimations. The findings offer critical insights for policymakers in homeland security and emergency management and provide a basis for more efficient resource allocation and improved disaster resilience.",

      "abstract": "We present a resource-planning game for cyber-security of networked control systems (NCS). The NCS is assumed to be operating in closed-loop using a linear state-feedback $\\mathcal{H}_2$ controller. A zero-sum, two-player Stackelberg game (SG) is developed between an attacker and a defender for this NCS. The attacker aims to disable communication of selected nodes and thereby render the feedback gain matrix to be sparse, leading to degradation of closed-loop performance, while the defender aims to prevent this loss by investing in the protection of targeted nodes. Both players trade their $\\mathcal{H}_2$-performance objectives for the costs of their actions. The standard backward induction method is modified to determine a cost-based Stackelberg equilibrium (CBSE) that saves the players' costs without degrading the control performance. We analyze the dependency of a CBSE on the relative budgets of the players as well as on the node \"importance\" order. Moreover, a robust-defense method is developed for the realistic case when the defender is not informed about the attacker's resources. The proposed algorithms are validated using examples from wide-area control of electric power systems. It is demonstrated that reliable and robust defense is feasible unless the defender's resources are severely limited relative to the attacker's resources. We also show that the proposed methods are robust to time-varying model uncertainties and thus are suitable for long-term security investment in realistic NCSs. Finally, we employ computationally efficient genetic algorithms (GA) to compute the optimal strategies of the attacker and the defender in realistic large power systems.",

      "abstract": "Budgeted uncertainty sets have been established as a major influence on uncertainty modeling for robust optimization problems. A drawback of such sets is that the budget constraint only restricts the global amount of cost increase that can be distributed by an adversary. Local restrictions, while being important for many applications, cannot be modeled this way.   We introduce new variant of budgeted uncertainty sets, called locally budgeted uncertainty. In this setting, the uncertain parameters become partitioned, such that a classic budgeted uncertainty set applies to each partition, called region.   In a theoretical analysis, we show that the robust counterpart of such problems for a constant number of regions remains solvable in polynomial time, if the underlying nominal problem can be solved in polynomial time as well. If the number of regions is unbounded, we show that the robust selection problem remains solvable in polynomial time, while also providing hardness results for other combinatorial problems.   In computational experiments using both random and real-world data, we show that using locally budgeted uncertainty sets can have considerable advantages over classic budgeted uncertainty sets.",

The model is implemented in the Python package called PuLP which can call several linear solver's Application Programming Interface (API), such as GLPK, COIN CLP/CBC, IBM CPLEX, and Gurobi. After comparing the performance of several solvers, we chose Gurobi in the production server.

      "abstract": "When planning the investment in Microgrids (MGs), usually static security constraints are included to ensure their resilience and ability to operate in islanded mode. However, unscheduled islanding events may trigger cascading disconnections of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) inside the MG due to the transient response, leading to a partial or full loss of load. In this paper, a min-max-min, hybrid, stochastic-robust investment planning model is proposed to obtain a resilient MG considering both High-Impact-Low-Frequency (HILF) and Low-Impact-High-Frequency (LIHF) uncertainties. The HILF uncertainty pertains to the unscheduled islanding of the MG after a disastrous event, and the LIHF uncertainty relates to correlated loads and DER generation, characterized by a set of scenarios. The MG resilience under both types of uncertainty is ensured by incorporating static and transient islanding constraints into the proposed investment model. The inclusion of transient response constraints leads to a min-max-min problem with a non-linear dynamic frequency response model that cannot be solved directly by available optimization tools. Thus, in this paper, a three-stage solution approach is proposed to find the optimal investment plan. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on the CIGRE 18-node distribution network.",

      "abstract": "When investing in cyber security resources, information security managers have to follow effective decision-making strategies. We refer to this as the cyber security investment challenge. In this paper, we consider three possible decision-support methodologies for security managers to tackle this challenge. We consider methods based on game theory, combinatorial optimisation and a hybrid of the two. Our modelling starts by building a framework where we can investigate the effectiveness of a cyber security control regarding the protection of different assets seen as targets in presence of commodity threats. In terms of game theory we consider a 2-person control game between the security manager who has to choose among different implementation levels of a cyber security control, and a commodity attacker who chooses among different targets to attack. The pure game theoretical methodology consists of a large game including all controls and all threats. In the hybrid methodology the game solutions of individual control-games along with their direct costs (e.g. financial) are combined with a knapsack algorithm to derive an optimal investment strategy. The combinatorial optimisation technique consists of a multi-objective multiple choice knapsack based strategy. We compare these approaches on a case study that was built on SANS top critical controls. The main achievements of this work is to highlight the weaknesses and strengths of different investment methodologies for cyber security, the benefit of their interaction, and the impact that indirect costs have on cyber security investment.",

However, such software does not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In this regard, an important research problem is the analysis of optimal user self-defense investments and cyber-insurance contracts under the Internet environment. In this paper, we investigate two problems and their relationship: 1) analyzing optimal self-defense investments in the Internet, under optimal cyber-insurance coverage, where optimality is an insurer objective and 2) designing optimal cyber-insurance contracts for Internet users, where a contract is a (premium, coverage) pair.",

Thanks to HW-NAS, a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN) is tailored on the ISCX VPN-nonVPN dataset to meet strict memory and computational limits while achieving robust performance. The optimized model attains an accuracy of 96.59% with just 88.26K parameters, 10.08M FLOPs, and a maximum tensor size of 20.12K. Compared to state-of-the-art models, it achieves reductions of up to 444-fold, 312-fold, and 15.6-fold in these metrics, respectively, significantly minimizing memory footprint and runtime requirements. The model also demonstrates versatility in classification tasks, achieving accuracies of up to 99.64% in VPN differentiation, VPN-type classification, broader traffic categories, and application identification. In addition, an in-depth approach to header-level preprocessing strategies confirms that the optimized model can provide notable performances across a wide range of configurations, even in scenarios with stricter privacy considerations. Likewise, a reduction in the length of sessions of up to 75% yields significant improvements in efficiency, while maintaining high accuracy with only a negligible drop of 1-2%. However, the importance of careful preprocessing and session length selection in the classification of raw traffic data is still present, as improper settings or aggressive reductions can bring about a 7% reduction in overall accuracy. Those results highlight the method's effectiveness in enforcing cybersecurity for IoT networks, by providing scalable, efficient solutions for the real-time analysis of encrypted traffic within strict hardware limitations.",

Specifically, we propose a mathematical model of cyber risk insurance and cybersecurity provisioning supported with an efficient numerical algorithm based on dynamic programming.

It appears that the mathematical problem is more complex than the traditional risk budgeting problem. The formulation of the optimization program is particularly critical in order to determine the right risk budgeting portfolio.

Indeed, we develop an algorithm that mixes the method of cyclical coordinate descent (CCD), alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), proximal operators and Dykstra's algorithm. This theoretical body is then applied to some investment problems. In particular, we show how to dynamically control the turnover of a risk parity portfolio and how to build smart beta portfolios based on the ERC approach by improving the liquidity of the portfolio or reducing the small cap bias. Finally, we highlight the importance of the homogeneity property of risk measures and discuss the related scaling puzzle.",

The market coefficients are assumed to depend on the market regime in place, which is modeled by a finite state continuous time Markov process. We rigorously deduce the dynamics of the defaultable bond price process in terms of a Markov modulated stochastic differential equation. Then, by separating the utility maximization problem into the pre-default and post-default scenarios, we deduce two coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations for the post and pre-default optimal value functions and show a novel verification theorem for their solutions. We obtain explicit optimal investment strategies and value functions for an investor with logarithmic utility. We finish with an economic analysis in the case of a market with two regimes and homogenous transition rates, and show the impact of the default intensities and loss rates on the optimal strategies and value functions.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems necessitates advanced, interpretable, and scalable intrusion detection systems (IDS) to combat emerging cyber threats. Traditional IDS face challenges such as high computational demands, limited explainability, and inflexibility against evolving attack patterns. To address these limitations, this study introduces the Lightweight Explainable Network Security framework (LENS-XAI), which combines robust intrusion detection with enhanced interpretability and scalability. LENS-XAI integrates knowledge distillation, variational autoencoder models, and attribution-based explainability techniques to achieve high detection accuracy and transparency in decision-making. By leveraging a training set comprising 10% of the available data, the framework optimizes computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. Experimental evaluation on four benchmark datasets: Edge-IIoTset, UKM-IDS20, CTU-13, and NSL-KDD, demonstrates the framework's superior performance, achieving detection accuracies of 95.34%, 99.92%, 98.42%, and 99.34%, respectively. Additionally, the framework excels in reducing false positives and adapting to complex attack scenarios, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Key strengths of LENS-XAI include its lightweight design, suitable for resource-constrained environments, and its scalability across diverse IIoT and cybersecurity contexts. Moreover, the explainability module enhances trust and transparency, critical for practical deployment in dynamic and sensitive applications. This research contributes significantly to advancing IDS by addressing computational efficiency, feature interpretability, and real-world applicability. Future work could focus on extending the framework to ensemble AI systems for distributed environments, further enhancing its robustness and adaptability.",

In this paper, we propose a hierarchical constrained stochastic shortest path problem (HC-SSP) that meets those two crucial requirements in a single framework. Although HC-SSP provides a useful framework to model such planning requirements in many real-world applications, the resulting problem has high complexity and makes it difficult to find an optimal solution fast which prevents user from applying it to real-time and risk-sensitive applications. To address this problem, we present an algorithm that iteratively allocates cost budget to lower level planning problems based on branch-and-bound scheme to find a feasible solution fast and incrementally update the incumbent solution. We demonstrate the proposed algorithm in an evacuation scenario and prove the advantage over a state-of-the-art mathematical programming based approach.",

We propose a variant of discrete budgeted uncertainty for cardinality-based constraints or objectives, where a weight vector is applied to the budget constraint. We show that while the adversarial problem can be solved in linear time, the robust problem becomes NP-hard and not approximable.

The joint optimization problem is modeled as a mixed binary integer programming problem subject to exclusive sub-carrier allocation and separate power budget constraints at each node. A joint optimization solution is obtained through Lagrangian dual decomposition where KKT conditions are exploited to find the optimal power allocation at base station. Further, to reduce the complexity, a sub-optimal scheme is presented where the optimal power allocation is derived under fixed sub-carrier-relay assignment.

The model combines game theory and combinatorial optimization taking into account the probability of each user group to being attacked, the value of assets accessible by each group, and the efficacy of each control for a particular group. The model considers indirect cost as the time employees could require for learning and training against an implemented control.

Our core contribution, the global myopic allocation (GMA) algorithm, is a solution to this problem. We prove that GMA can compute unconditional allocations for all paths on a graph, while never over-allocating resources.

Mannor et al. (ICML '12) showed that optimal randomized policies for MDPs in the LDST regime can be efficiently computed when only the rewards are affected by uncertainty. In contrast to these findings, we observe that the computation of optimal deterministic policies is $N\\!P$-hard even when only a single terminal reward may deviate from its nominal value and the MDP consists of $2$ time periods. For this hard special case, we then derive a constant-factor approximation algorithm by combining two relaxations based on the Knapsack Cover and Generalized Assignment problem, respectively. For the general problem with possibly a large number of deviations and a longer time horizon, we derive strong inapproximability results for computing robust deterministic policies as well as $\\Sigma_2^p$-hardness, indicating that the general problem does not even admit a compact mixed integer programming formulation.",

We argue that, unlike PARO, extant solution approaches -- including those that adopt Pareto Robust Optimality from static robust optimization -- could fail in ARO and yield solutions that can be Pareto dominated. The latter could lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance in practice. We prove the existence of PARO solutions, and present particular approaches for finding and approximating such solutions.

      "abstract": "We explore a scenario involving two sites and a sequential game between a defender and an attacker, where the defender is responsible for securing the sites while the attacker aims to attack them. Each site holds a loss value for the defender when compromised, along with a probability of successful attack. The defender can reduce these probabilities through security investments at each site. The attacker's objective is to target the site that maximizes the expected loss for the defender, taking into account the defender's security investments. While previous studies have examined security investments in such scenarios, our work investigates the impact of bounded rationality exhibited by the defender, as identified in behavioral economics. Specifically, we consider quantal behavioral bias, where humans make errors in selecting efficient (pure) strategies. We demonstrate the existence of a quantal response equilibrium in our sequential game and analyze how this bias affects the defender's choice of optimal security investments. Additionally, we quantify the inefficiency of equilibrium investments under quantal decision-making compared to an optimal solution devoid of behavioral biases. We provide numerical simulations to validate our main findings.",

With respect to these optimal problems, we analyze a quenched disordered system involving both of these optimization problems using the approach developed in statistical mechanical informatics, and confirm that both optimal portfolios can possess the primal-dual structure.

In literature the latter is solved by assuming {\\it a priori} that the problem is well-posed (i.e., the supremum value is finite) and a Lagrange multiplier exists (and as a consequence the optimal solution is attainable). In this paper it is first shown, via various counter-examples, neither of these two assumptions needs to hold, and an optimal solution does not necessarily exist. These anomalies in turn have important interpretations in and impacts on the portfolio selection modeling and solutions. Relations among the non-existence of the Lagrange multiplier, the ill-posedness of the problem, and the non-attainability of an optimal solution are then investigated. Finally, explicit and easily verifiable conditions are derived which lead to finding the unique optimal solution.",

      "abstract": "This paper studies binary linear programming problems in the presence of uncertainties that may cause solution values to change during implementation. This type of uncertainty, termed implementation uncertainty, is modeled explicitly affecting the decision variables rather than model parameters. The binary nature of the decision variables invalidates the use of the existing models for this type of uncertainty. The robust solutions obtained are optimal for a worst-case min-max objective and allow a controlled degree of infeasibility with respect to the associated deterministic problem. Structural properties are used to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear binary program. The degree of solution conservatism is controlled by combining both constraint relaxation and cardinality-constrained parameters. Solutions for optimization problems under implementation uncertainty consist of a set of robust solutions; the selection of solutions from this possibly large set is formulated as an optimization problem over the robust set. Results from an experimental study in the context of the knapsack problem suggest the methodology yields solutions that perform well in terms of objective value and feasibility. Furthermore, the selection approach can identify robust solutions that possess desirable implementation characteristics.",

To reduce the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense mechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In reality, an Internet user faces risks due to security attacks as well as risks due to non-security related failures (e.g., reliability faults in the form of hardware crash, buffer overflow, etc.) . These risk types are often indistinguishable by a naive user. However, a cyber-insurance agency would most likely insure risks only due to security attacks. In this case, it becomes a challenge for an Internet user to choose the right type of cyber-insurance contract as standard optimal contracts, i.e., contracts under security attacks only, might prove to be sub-optimal for himself. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing cyber-insurance solutions when a user faces risks due to both, security as well as non-security related failures. We propose \\emph{Aegis}, a novel cyber-insurance model in which the user accepts a fraction \\emph{(strictly positive)} of loss recovery on himself and transfers rest of the loss recovery on the cyber-insurance agency. We mathematically show that given an option, Internet users would prefer Aegis contracts to traditional cyber-insurance contracts, under all premium types. This result firmly establishes the non-existence of traditional cyber-insurance markets when Aegis contracts are offered to users.",

      "abstract": "This paper considers the estimation of treatment assignment rules when the policy maker faces a general budget or resource constraint. Utilizing the PAC-Bayesian framework, we propose new treatment assignment rules that allow for flexible notions of treatment outcome, treatment cost, and a budget constraint. For example, the constraint setting allows for cost-savings, when the costs of non-treatment exceed those of treatment for a subpopulation, to be factored into the budget. It also accommodates simpler settings, such as quantity constraints, and doesn't require outcome responses and costs to have the same unit of measurement. Importantly, the approach accounts for settings where budget or resource limitations may preclude treating all that can benefit, where costs may vary with individual characteristics, and where there may be uncertainty regarding the cost of treatment rules of interest. Despite the nomenclature, our theoretical analysis examines frequentist properties of the proposed rules. For stochastic rules that typically approach budget-penalized empirical welfare maximizing policies in larger samples, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for the target population costs and sharp oracle-type inequalities that compare the rules' welfare regret to that of optimal policies in relevant budget categories. A closely related, non-stochastic, model aggregation treatment assignment rule is shown to inherit desirable attributes.",

However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.",

      "abstract": "The Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) is a fundamental optimization model for Transmission System Operators (TSO) to clear real-time energy markets while ensuring reliable operations of power grids. In a context of growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable generators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously monitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system's behavior under various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately, systematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not practical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e., a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in milliseconds. Motivated by a principled analysis of the market-clearing optimizations of MISO, the paper proposes a novel ML pipeline that addresses the main challenges of learning SCED solutions, i.e., the variability in load, renewable output and production costs, as well as the combinatorial structure of commitment decisions. A novel Classification-Then-Regression architecture is also proposed, to further capture the behavior of SCED solutions. Numerical experiments are reported on the French transmission system, and demonstrate the approach's ability to produce, within a time frame that is compatible with real-time operations, accurate optimization proxies that produce relative errors below $0.6\\%$.",

In this paper, we study a class of problems with resource uncertainty and propose a robust optimization methodology that produces solutions that are even less conservative than the conventional budget-of-uncertainty approach. We propose a new tractable two-stage robust optimization approach that identifies the \"ineffective\" parts of the uncertainty set and optimizes for the \"effective\" worst-case scenario only. In the first stage, we identify the effective range of the uncertain parameter, and in the second stage, we provide a formulation that eliminates the unnecessary protection for the ineffective parts, and hence, produces less conservative solutions and provides intuitive insights on the trade-off between robustness and solution conservatism. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using a power dispatch optimization problem with wind uncertainty. We also provide examples of other application areas that would benefit from the proposed approach.",
