      "abstract": "Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.",

      "abstract": "Homeland security in the United States faces a daunting task due to the multiple threats and hazards that can occur. Natural disasters, human-caused incidents such as terrorist attacks, and technological failures can result in significant damage, fatalities, injuries, and economic losses. The increasing frequency and severity of disruptive events in the United States highlight the urgent need for effectively allocating resources in homeland security and emergency preparedness. This article presents an optimization-based decision support model to help homeland security policymakers identify and select projects that best mitigate the risk of threats and hazards while satisfying a budget constraint. The model incorporates multiple hazards, probabilistic risk assessments, and multidimensional consequences and integrates historical data and publicly available sources to evaluate and select the most effective risk mitigation projects and optimize resource allocation across various disaster scenarios. We apply this model to the state of Iowa, considering 16 hazards, six types of consequences, and 52 mitigation projects. Our results demonstrate how different budget levels influence project selection, emphasizing cost-effective solutions that maximize risk reduction. Sensitivity analysis examines the robustness of project selection under varying effectiveness assumptions and consequence estimations. The findings offer critical insights for policymakers in homeland security and emergency management and provide a basis for more efficient resource allocation and improved disaster resilience.",

This progress sets the stage for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, which present new complexity and performance requirements challenges. Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models have been widely used to model the optimization of resource allocation problems in networks. This paper reviews 103 studies on resource allocation strategies in 5G and B5G, focusing specifically on optimization problems modelled as LP, ILP, and MILP. The selected studies are categorized based on network architectures, types of resource allocation problems, and specific objective functions and constraints. The review also discusses solution methods for NP-hard ILP and MILP problems by categorizing the solution methods into different categories. Additionally, emerging trends, such as integrating AI and machine learning with optimization models, are explored, suggesting promising future research directions in network optimization. The paper concludes that LP, ILP, and MILP models have been widely adopted across various network architectures, resource types, objective functions, and constraints and remain critical to optimizing next-generation networks.",

In this model, designed to provide robustness in the face of uncertain input data while not being overly conservative, transition probabilities and rewards are uncertain and the uncertainty set is constrained by a budget that limits the number of states whose parameters can deviate from their nominal values.   Mannor et al. (ICML '12) showed that optimal randomized policies for MDPs in the LDST regime can be efficiently computed when only the rewards are affected by uncertainty. In contrast to these findings, we observe that the computation of optimal deterministic policies is $N\\!P$-hard even when only a single terminal reward may deviate from its nominal value and the MDP consists of $2$ time periods. For this hard special case, we then derive a constant-factor approximation algorithm by combining two relaxations based on the Knapsack Cover and Generalized Assignment problem, respectively. For the general problem with possibly a large number of deviations and a longer time horizon, we derive strong inapproximability results for computing robust deterministic policies as well as $\\Sigma_2^p$-hardness, indicating that the general problem does not even admit a compact mixed integer programming formulation.",

The uncertainty in the return distribution is quantified using the \\emph{Wasserstein} metric, which captures distributional ambiguity. We establish conditions that ensure robustly survivable trades for all distributions in the Wasserstein ball under convex transaction costs. By leveraging duality theory, we approximate the infinite-dimensional distributionally robust optimization problem with a finite convex program, enabling computational tractability for mid-sized portfolios. Empirical studies using S\\&P 500 data validate our theoretical framework: without transaction costs, the optimal portfolio converges to an equal-weighted allocation, while with transaction costs, the portfolio shifts slightly towards the risk-free asset, reflecting the trade-off between cost considerations and optimal allocation.",

Each site holds a loss value for the defender when compromised, along with a probability of successful attack. The defender can reduce these probabilities through security investments at each site. The attacker's objective is to target the site that maximizes the expected loss for the defender, taking into account the defender's security investments. While previous studies have examined security investments in such scenarios, our work investigates the impact of bounded rationality exhibited by the defender, as identified in behavioral economics. Specifically, we consider quantal behavioral bias, where humans make errors in selecting efficient (pure) strategies. We demonstrate the existence of a quantal response equilibrium in our sequential game and analyze how this bias affects the defender's choice of optimal security investments. Additionally, we quantify the inefficiency of equilibrium investments under quantal decision-making compared to an optimal solution devoid of behavioral biases.

      "abstract": "This paper considers the estimation of treatment assignment rules when the policy maker faces a general budget or resource constraint. Utilizing the PAC-Bayesian framework, we propose new treatment assignment rules that allow for flexible notions of treatment outcome, treatment cost, and a budget constraint. For example, the constraint setting allows for cost-savings, when the costs of non-treatment exceed those of treatment for a subpopulation, to be factored into the budget. It also accommodates simpler settings, such as quantity constraints, and doesn't require outcome responses and costs to have the same unit of measurement. Importantly, the approach accounts for settings where budget or resource limitations may preclude treating all that can benefit, where costs may vary with individual characteristics, and where there may be uncertainty regarding the cost of treatment rules of interest. Despite the nomenclature, our theoretical analysis examines frequentist properties of the proposed rules. For stochastic rules that typically approach budget-penalized empirical welfare maximizing policies in larger samples, we derive non-asymptotic generalization bounds for the target population costs and sharp oracle-type inequalities that compare the rules' welfare regret to that of optimal policies in relevant budget categories. A closely related, non-stochastic, model aggregation treatment assignment rule is shown to inherit desirable attributes.",

      "abstract": "The Security-Constrained Economic Dispatch (SCED) is a fundamental optimization model for Transmission System Operators (TSO) to clear real-time energy markets while ensuring reliable operations of power grids. In a context of growing operational uncertainty, due to increased penetration of renewable generators and distributed energy resources, operators must continuously monitor risk in real-time, i.e., they must quickly assess the system's behavior under various changes in load and renewable production. Unfortunately, systematically solving an optimization problem for each such scenario is not practical given the tight constraints of real-time operations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes to learn an optimization proxy for SCED, i.e., a Machine Learning (ML) model that can predict an optimal solution for SCED in milliseconds. Motivated by a principled analysis of the market-clearing optimizations of MISO, the paper proposes a novel ML pipeline that addresses the main challenges of learning SCED solutions, i.e., the variability in load, renewable output and production costs, as well as the combinatorial structure of commitment decisions. A novel Classification-Then-Regression architecture is also proposed, to further capture the behavior of SCED solutions. Numerical experiments are reported on the French transmission system, and demonstrate the approach's ability to produce, within a time frame that is compatible with real-time operations, accurate optimization proxies that produce relative errors below $0.6\\%$.",

We also apply a matrix completion technique to lower-level SDO problems to make their problem sizes much smaller. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our cutting-plane algorithm is significantly faster than the state-of-the-art MISDO solver SCIP-SDP.

      "abstract": "This paper studies binary linear programming problems in the presence of uncertainties that may cause solution values to change during implementation. This type of uncertainty, termed implementation uncertainty, is modeled explicitly affecting the decision variables rather than model parameters. The binary nature of the decision variables invalidates the use of the existing models for this type of uncertainty. The robust solutions obtained are optimal for a worst-case min-max objective and allow a controlled degree of infeasibility with respect to the associated deterministic problem. Structural properties are used to reformulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear binary program. The degree of solution conservatism is controlled by combining both constraint relaxation and cardinality-constrained parameters. Solutions for optimization problems under implementation uncertainty consist of a set of robust solutions; the selection of solutions from this possibly large set is formulated as an optimization problem over the robust set. Results from an experimental study in the context of the knapsack problem suggest the methodology yields solutions that perform well in terms of objective value and feasibility. Furthermore, the selection approach can identify robust solutions that possess desirable implementation characteristics.",

In this scenario we formalize the distributed path-allocation (PAdist) problem, which consists in allocating resources to paths considering only local on-path information -- importantly, not knowing which other paths could have an allocation -- while at the same time achieving the global property of never exceeding available resources.   Our core contribution, the global myopic allocation (GMA) algorithm, is a solution to this problem. We prove that GMA can compute unconditional allocations for all paths on a graph, while never over-allocating resources. Further, we prove that GMA is Pareto optimal with respect to the allocation size, and it has linear complexity in the input size. Finally, we show with simulations that this theoretical result could be indeed applied to practical scenarios, as the resulting path allocations are large enough to fit the requirements of practically relevant applications.",

We argue that, unlike PARO, extant solution approaches -- including those that adopt Pareto Robust Optimality from static robust optimization -- could fail in ARO and yield solutions that can be Pareto dominated. The latter could lead to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance in practice. We prove the existence of PARO solutions, and present particular approaches for finding and approximating such solutions. We present numerical results for a facility location problem that demonstrate the practical value of PARO solutions. Our analysis of PARO relies on an application of Fourier-Motzkin Elimination as a proof technique. We demonstrate how this technique can be valuable in the analysis of ARO problems, besides PARO.

      "abstract": "Cyber hygiene measures are often recommended for strengthening an organization's security posture, especially for protecting against social engineering attacks that target the human element. However, the related recommendations are typically the same for all organizations and their employees, regardless of the nature and the level of risk for different groups of users. Building upon an existing cybersecurity investment model, this paper presents a tool for optimal selection of cyber hygiene safeguards, which we refer as the Optimal Safeguards Tool. The model combines game theory and combinatorial optimization taking into account the probability of each user group to being attacked, the value of assets accessible by each group, and the efficacy of each control for a particular group. The model considers indirect cost as the time employees could require for learning and training against an implemented control. Utilizing a game-theoretic framework to support the Knapsack optimization problem permits us to optimally select safeguards' application levels minimizing the aggregated expected damage within a security investment budget. We evaluate OST in a healthcare domain use case. The Critical Internet Security Control group 17 for implementing security awareness and training programs for employees belonging to the ICT, clinical and administration personnel of a hospital. We compare the strategies implemented by OST against alternative common-sense defending approaches for three different types of attackers: Nash, Weighted and Opportunistic. Nash defending strategies are consistently better than the competing strategies for all attacker types with a minor exception where the Nash defending strategy performs at least as good as other common-sense approaches.",

The optimal strategy is derived analytically under the worst-case scenario with or without derivative trading. To illustrate the effects of ambiguity, we compare our optimal robust strategy with some strategies that ignore the information of uncertainty, and provide the corresponding welfare analysis. The effects of derivative trading to the optimal portfolio selection are also discussed by considering alternative strategies. Our study is further extended to the cases with jump risks in asset price and correlated volatility factors, respectively.

      "abstract": "Robust optimization (RO) tackles data uncertainty by optimizing for the worst-case scenario of an uncertain parameter and, in its basic form, is sometimes criticized for producing overly-conservative solutions. To reduce the level of conservatism in RO, one can use the well-known budget-of-uncertainty approach which limits the amount of uncertainty to be considered in the model. In this paper, we study a class of problems with resource uncertainty and propose a robust optimization methodology that produces solutions that are even less conservative than the conventional budget-of-uncertainty approach. We propose a new tractable two-stage robust optimization approach that identifies the \"ineffective\" parts of the uncertainty set and optimizes for the \"effective\" worst-case scenario only. In the first stage, we identify the effective range of the uncertain parameter, and in the second stage, we provide a formulation that eliminates the unnecessary protection for the ineffective parts, and hence, produces less conservative solutions and provides intuitive insights on the trade-off between robustness and solution conservatism. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach using a power dispatch optimization problem with wind uncertainty. We also provide examples of other application areas that would benefit from the proposed approach.",

This financial intermediary decides on the unit transaction costs for investing in some securities, maximizing its benefits, and the investor chooses his optimal portfolio, minimizing risk and ensuring a given expected return. Hence, transaction costs become decision variables in the portfolio problem, and two levels of decision-makers are incorporated: the financial intermediary and the investor. These situations give rise to general Nonlinear Programming formulations in both levels of the decision process. We present different bilevel versions of the problem: financial intermediary-leader, investor-leader, and social welfare; besides, their properties are analyzed. Moreover, we develop Mixed Integer Linear Programming formulations for some of the proposed problems and effective algorithms for some others. Finally, we report on some computational experiments performed on data taken from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and analyze and compare the results obtained by the different models.",

      "abstract": "When undertaking cyber security risk assessments, we must assign numeric values to metrics to compute the final expected loss that represents the risk that an organization is exposed to due to cyber threats. Even if risk assessment is motivated from real-world observations and data, there is always a high chance of assigning inaccurate values due to different uncertainties involved (e.g., evolving threat landscape, human errors) and the natural difficulty of quantifying risk per se. Our previous work has proposed a model and a software tool that empowers organizations to compute optimal cyber security strategies given their financial constraints, i.e., available cyber security budget. We have also introduced a general game-theoretic model with uncertain payoffs (probability-distribution-valued payoffs) showing that such uncertainty can be incorporated in the game-theoretic model by allowing payoffs to be random. In this paper, we combine our aforesaid works and we conclude that although uncertainties in cyber security risk assessment lead, on average, to different cyber security strategies, they do not play significant role into the final expected loss of the organization when using our model and methodology to derive this strategies. We show that our tool is capable of providing effective decision support. To the best of our knowledge this is the first paper that investigates how uncertainties on various parameters affect cyber security investments.",

With respect to these optimal problems, we analyze a quenched disordered system involving both of these optimization problems using the approach developed in statistical mechanical informatics, and confirm that both optimal portfolios can possess the primal-dual structure.

      "abstract": "Internet users such as individuals and organizations are subject to different types of epidemic risks such as worms, viruses, and botnets. To reduce the probability of risk, an Internet user generally invests in self-defense mechanisms like antivirus and antispam software. However, such software does not completely eliminate risk. Recent works have considered the problem of residual risk elimination by proposing the idea of cyber-insurance. In reality, an Internet user faces risks due to security attacks as well as risks due to non-security related failures (e.g., reliability faults in the form of hardware crash, buffer overflow, etc.) . These risk types are often indistinguishable by a naive user. However, a cyber-insurance agency would most likely insure risks only due to security attacks. In this case, it becomes a challenge for an Internet user to choose the right type of cyber-insurance contract as standard optimal contracts, i.e., contracts under security attacks only, might prove to be sub-optimal for himself. In this paper, we address the problem of analyzing cyber-insurance solutions when a user faces risks due to both, security as well as non-security related failures. We propose \\emph{Aegis}, a novel cyber-insurance model in which the user accepts a fraction \\emph{(strictly positive)} of loss recovery on himself and transfers rest of the loss recovery on the cyber-insurance agency. We mathematically show that given an option, Internet users would prefer Aegis contracts to traditional cyber-insurance contracts, under all premium types. This result firmly establishes the non-existence of traditional cyber-insurance markets when Aegis contracts are offered to users.",

In literature the latter is solved by assuming {\\it a priori} that the problem is well-posed (i.e., the supremum value is finite) and a Lagrange multiplier exists (and as a consequence the optimal solution is attainable). In this paper it is first shown, via various counter-examples, neither of these two assumptions needs to hold, and an optimal solution does not necessarily exist. These anomalies in turn have important interpretations in and impacts on the portfolio selection modeling and solutions. Relations among the non-existence of the Lagrange multiplier, the ill-posedness of the problem, and the non-attainability of an optimal solution are then investigated. Finally, explicit and easily verifiable conditions are derived which lead to finding the unique optimal solution.",
