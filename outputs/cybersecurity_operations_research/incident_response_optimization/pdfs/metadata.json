      "abstract": "Coordinating the charging scheduling of electric vehicles for dynamic dial-a-ride services is challenging considering charging queuing delays and stochastic customer demand. We propose a new two-stage solution approach to handle dynamic vehicle charging scheduling to minimize the costs of daily charging operations of the fleet. The approach comprises two components: daily vehicle charging scheduling and online vehicle-charger assignment. A new battery charge scheduling model is proposed to obtain the vehicle charging schedules by minimizing the costs of vehicle daily charging operations while satisfying vehicle driving needs to serve customers. In the second stage, an online vehicle-charger assignment model is developed to minimize the total vehicle idle time for charges by considering queuing delays at the level of chargers. An efficient Lagrangian relaxation algorithm is proposed to solve the large-scale vehicle-charger assignment problem with small optimality gaps. The approach is applied to a realistic dynamic dial-a-ride service case study in Luxembourg and compared with the nearest charging station charging policy and first-come-first-served minimum charging delay policy under different charging infrastructure scenarios. Our computational results show that the approach can achieve significant savings for the operator in terms of charging waiting times (-74.9%), charging times (-38.6%), and charged energy costs (-27.4%). A sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the impact of the different model parameters, showing the scalability and robustness of the approach in a stochastic environment.",

      "abstract": "Unmanned warehouses are an important part of logistics, and improving their operational efficiency can effectively enhance service efficiency. However, due to the complexity of unmanned warehouse systems and their susceptibility to errors, incidents may occur during their operation, most often in inbound and outbound operations, which can decrease operational efficiency. Hence it is crucial to to improve the response to such incidents. This paper proposes a collaborative optimization algorithm for emergent incident response based on Safe-MADDPG. To meet safety requirements during emergent incident response, we investigated the intrinsic hidden relationships between various factors. By obtaining constraint information of agents during the emergent incident response process and of the dynamic environment of unmanned warehouses on agents, the algorithm reduces safety risks and avoids the occurrence of chain accidents; this enables an unmanned system to complete emergent incident response tasks and achieve its optimization objectives: (1) minimizing the losses caused by emergent incidents; and (2) maximizing the operational efficiency of inbound and outbound operations during the response process. A series of experiments conducted in a simulated unmanned warehouse scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

      "abstract": "In the Home Service Assignment, Routing, and Appointment scheduling (H-SARA) problem, a set of homogeneous service teams must visit a set of customers. The home service provider needs to decide how many teams to hire (i.e., sizing problem), how to assign service teams to customers (i.e., assignment problem), how to route service teams (i.e., vehicle routing problem),and how to schedule the appointment times for the customers (i.e., appointment scheduling problem) such that the total cost is minimized. To tackle the H-SARA problem, we propose an efficient solution method that comprises two stages. In the first stage, we present a column generation algorithm to solve the sizing, assignment, and routing problem. The algorithm is enhanced by a high-quality initial solution which is found using the route-first cluster-second principle and a polynomial-time 2-approximation algorithm. In the second stage, due to the stochastic nature of travel time, service time, and cancellation, we propose a simulation-driven approach to decide the appointment times such that a desired on-time arrival probability is achieved. To ensure the suitability of the simulation model, we discuss the characterization of the stochastic parameters. The proposed ideas can be embedded in different solution schemes, including a fast heuristic method that finds good solutions within seconds or a more elaborate algorithm to find near-optimal solutions at the expense of longer computational time. At last, we provide a high-level flexible decision support tool implemented in AIMMS.",

Such new scenario is motivated by the proliferation of real-time applications in multimedia communication systems, tactile Internet, networked controlled systems, and cyber-physical systems. The delay-constrained input-queued switch is completely different from the well-understood delay-unconstrained one and thus poses new challenges. We focus on three fundamental problems centering around the performance metric of timely throughput: (i) how to characterize the capacity region? (ii) how to design a feasibility/throughput-optimal scheduling policy? and (iii) how to design a network-utility-maximization scheduling policy? We use three different approaches to solve these three fundamental problems. The first approach is based on Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory, which can solve all three problems. However, it suffers from the curse of dimensionality. The second approach breaks the curse of dimensionality by exploiting the combinatorial features of the problem. It gives a new capacity region characterization with only a polynomial number of linear constraints. The third approach is based on the framework of Lyapunov optimization, where we design a polynomial-time maximum-weight T-disjoint-matching scheduling policy which is proved to be feasibility/throughput-optimal. Our three approaches apply to the frame-synchronized traffic pattern but our MDP-based approach can be extended to more general traffic patterns.",

      "abstract": "Infrastructure as a Service model of cloud computing is a desirable platform for the execution of cost and deadline constrained workflow applications as the elasticity of cloud computing allows large-scale complex scientific workflow applications to scale dynamically according to their deadline requirements. However, scheduling of these multitask workflow jobs in a distributed computing environment is a computationally hard multi-objective combinatorial optimization problem. The critical challenge is to schedule the workflow tasks whilst meeting user quality of service (QoS) requirements and the application's deadline. The existing research work not only fails to address this challenge but also do not incorporate the basic principles of elasticity and heterogeneity of computing resources in cloud environment. In this paper, we propose a resource provisioning and scheduling algorithm to schedule the workflow applications on IaaS clouds to meet application deadline constraints while optimizing the execution cost. The proposed algorithm is based on the nature-inspired population based Intelligent Water Drop (IWD) optimization algorithm. The experimental results in the simulated environment of CloudSim with four real-world workflow applications demonstrates that IWD algorithm schedules workflow tasks with optimized cost within the specified deadlines. Moreover, the IWD algorithm converges fast to near optimal solution.",

      "abstract": "Scheduling query execution plans is a particularly complex problem in shared-nothing parallel systems, where each site consists of a collection of local time-shared (e.g., CPU(s) or disk(s)) and space-shared (e.g., memory) resources and communicates with remote sites by message-passing. Earlier work on parallel query scheduling employs either (a) one-dimensional models of parallel task scheduling, effectively ignoring the potential benefits of resource sharing, or (b) models of globally accessible resource units, which are appropriate only for shared-memory architectures, since they cannot capture the affinity of system resources to sites. In this paper, we develop a general approach capturing the full complexity of scheduling distributed, multi-dimensional resource units for all forms of parallelism within and across queries and operators. We present a level-based list scheduling heuristic algorithm for independent query tasks (i.e., physical operator pipelines) that is provably near-optimal for given degrees of partitioned parallelism (with a worst-case performance ratio that depends on the number of time-shared and space-shared resources per site and the granularity of the clones). We also propose extensions to handle blocking constraints in logical operator (e.g., hash-join) pipelines and bushy query plans as well as on-line task arrivals (e.g., in a dynamic or multi-query execution environment). Experiments with our scheduling algorithms implemented on top of a detailed simulation model verify their effectiveness compared to existing approaches in a realistic setting. Based on our analytical and experimental results, we revisit the open problem of designing efficient cost models for parallel query optimization and propose a solution that captures all the important parameters of parallel execution.",

However, the question of delay-optimal scheduling in input-queued switches remains open in general, as does the question of delay-optimal scheduling under more general objective functions. To gain fundamental insights into these very difficult problems, we consider a fluid model of $n \\times n$ input-queued switches with associated fluid-flow costs, and we derive an optimal scheduling control policy to an infinite horizon discounted control problem with a general linear objective function of fluid cost. Our optimal policy coincides with the $c\\mu$-rule in certain parameter domains. More generally, due to the input-queued switch constraints, the optimal policy takes the form of the solution to a flow maximization problem, after we identify the Lagrangian multipliers of some key constraints through carefully designed algorithms. Computational experiments demonstrate the benefits of our optimal scheduling policy over variants of max-weight scheduling within fluid models of input-queued switches.",

      "abstract": "We study a target-following variation of online resource allocation. As in classical resource allocation, the decision-maker must assign sequentially arriving jobs to one of multiple available resources. However, in addition to the assignment costs incurred from these decisions, the decision-maker is also penalized for deviating from exogenously given, nonstationary target allocations throughout the horizon. The goal is to minimize the total expected assignment and deviation penalty costs incurred throughout the horizon when the distribution of assignment costs is unknown. In contrast to traditional online resource allocation, in our setting the timing of allocation decisions is critical due to the nonstationarity of allocation targets. Examples of practical problems that fit this framework include many physical resource settings where capacity is time-varying, such as manual warehouse processes where staffing levels change over time, and assignment of packages to outbound trucks whose departure times are scheduled throughout the day. We first show that naive extensions of state-of-the-art algorithms for classical resource allocation problems can fail dramatically when applied to target-following resource allocation. We then propose a novel ``proxy assignment\" primal-dual algorithm for the target-following online resource allocation problem that uses current arrivals to simulate the effect of future arrivals. We prove that our algorithm incurs the optimal $O(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound when the assignment costs of the arriving jobs are drawn i.i.d. from a fixed distribution. We demonstrate the practical performance of our approach by conducting numerical experiments on synthetic datasets, as well as real-world datasets from retail fulfillment operations.",

      "abstract": "Queuing network control is essential for managing congestion in job-processing systems such as service systems, communication networks, and manufacturing processes. Despite growing interest in applying reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, queueing network control poses distinct challenges, including high stochasticity, large state and action spaces, and lack of stability. To tackle these challenges, we propose a scalable framework for policy optimization based on differentiable discrete event simulation. Our main insight is that by implementing a well-designed smoothing technique for discrete event dynamics, we can compute pathwise policy gradients for large-scale queueing networks using auto-differentiation software (e.g., Tensorflow, PyTorch) and GPU parallelization. Through extensive empirical experiments, we observe that our policy gradient estimators are several orders of magnitude more accurate than typical REINFORCE-based estimators. In addition, We propose a new policy architecture, which drastically improves stability while maintaining the flexibility of neural-network policies. In a wide variety of scheduling and admission control tasks, we demonstrate that training control policies with pathwise gradients leads to a 50-1000x improvement in sample efficiency over state-of-the-art RL methods. Unlike prior tailored approaches to queueing, our methods can flexibly handle realistic scenarios, including systems operating in non-stationary environments and those with non-exponential interarrival/service times.",

A relatively new offering by companies is curbside pickup where customers purchase goods online, schedule a pickup time, and come to a pickup facility to receive their orders. To model this new service structure, we consider a queuing system where each arriving job has a preferred service completion time. Unlike most queuing systems, we make a strategic decision for when to serve each job based on their requested times and the associated costs. We assume that all jobs must be served before or on their requested time period, and the jobs are outsourced when the capacity is insufficient. Costs are incurred for jobs that are outsourced or served early. For small systems, we show that optimal capacity allocation policies are of threshold type. For general systems, we devise heuristic policies based on similar threshold structures. Our numerical study investigates the performance of the heuristics developed and shows the robustness of them with respect to several service parameters. Our results provide insights on how the optimal long-run average costs change based on the capacity of the system, the length of the planning horizon, cost parameters and the order pattern.",

      "abstract": "Staff scheduling is a well-known problem in operations research and finds its application at hospitals, airports, supermarkets, and many others. Its goal is to assign shifts to staff members such that a certain objective function, e.g. revenue, is maximized. Meanwhile, various constraints of the staff members and the organization need to be satisfied. Typically in staff scheduling problems, there are hard constraints on the minimum number of employees that should be available at specific points of time. Often multiple hard constraints guaranteeing the availability of specific number of employees with different roles need to be considered. Staff scheduling for demand-responsive services, such as, e.g., ride-pooling and ride-hailing services, differs in a key way from this: There are often no hard constraints on the minimum number of employees needed at fixed points in time. Rather, the number of employees working at different points in time should vary according to the demand at those points in time. Having too few employees at a point in time results in lost revenue, while having too many employees at a point in time results in not having enough employees at other points in time, since the total personnel-hours are limited. The objective is to maximize the total reward generated over a planning horizon, given a monotonic relationship between the number of shifts active at a point in time and the instantaneous reward generated at that point in time. This key difference makes it difficult to use existing staff scheduling algorithms for planning shifts in demand-responsive services. In this article, we present a novel approach for modelling and solving staff scheduling problems for demand-responsive services that optimizes for the relevant reward function.",

      "abstract": "Scientific workflows typically comprise a multitude of different processing steps which often are executed in parallel on different partitions of the input data. These executions, in turn, must be scheduled on the compute nodes of the computational infrastructure at hand. This assignment is complicated by the facts that (a) tasks typically have highly heterogeneous resource requirements and (b) in many infrastructures, compute nodes offer highly heterogeneous resources. In consequence, predictions of the runtime of a given task on a given node, as required by many scheduling algorithms, are often rather imprecise, which can lead to sub-optimal scheduling decisions.   We propose Reshi, a method for recommending task-node assignments during workflow execution that can cope with heterogeneous tasks and heterogeneous nodes. Reshi approaches the problem as a regression task, where task-node pairs are modeled as feature vectors over the results of dedicated micro benchmarks and past task executions. Based on these features, Reshi trains a regression tree model to rank and recommend nodes for each ready-to-run task, which can be used as input to a scheduler. For our evaluation, we benchmarked 27 AWS machine types using three representative workflows. We compare Reshi's recommendations with three state-of-the-art schedulers. Our evaluation shows that Reshi outperforms HEFT by a mean makespan reduction of 7.18% and 18.01% assuming a mean task runtime prediction error of 15%.",

In the case where the required capacity exceeds the available capacity of internal resources, external human resources are used. The objective is to minimize the expected external costs. The first solution approach is a 'matheuristic' based on a decomposition of the problem into a project scheduling subproblem and a staffing subproblem. An iterated local search procedure determines the project schedules, while the staffing subproblem is solved by means of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for convex optimization. The second solution approach is Sample Average Approximation where, based on sampled scenarios, the deterministic equivalent problem is solved through mixed integer programming. Experimental results for synthetically generated test instances inspired by a real-world situation are provided, and some managerial insights are derived.",

      "abstract": "Since beginning of Grid computing, scheduling of dependent tasks application has attracted attention of researchers due to NP-Complete nature of the problem. In Grid environment, scheduling is deciding about assignment of tasks to available resources. Scheduling in Grid is challenging when the tasks have dependencies and resources are heterogeneous. The main objective in scheduling of dependent tasks is minimizing make-span. Due to NP-complete nature of scheduling problem, exact solutions cannot generate schedule efficiently. Therefore, researchers apply heuristic or random search techniques to get optimal or near to optimal solution of such problems. In this paper, we show how Genetic Algorithm can be used to solve dependent task scheduling problem. We describe how initial population can be generated using random assignment and height based approaches. We also present design of crossover and mutation operators to enable scheduling of dependent tasks application without violating dependency constraints. For implementation of GA based scheduling, we explore and analyze SimGrid and GridSim simulation toolkits. From results, we found that SimGrid is suitable, as it has support of SimDag API for DAG applications. We found that GA based approach can generate schedule for dependent tasks application in reasonable time while trying to minimize make-span.",

      "abstract": "In this study, we propose a three-stage framework for the planning and scheduling of high-capacity mobility-on-demand services (e.g., micro transit and flexible transit) at urban activity hubs. The proposed framework consists of (1) the route generation step to and from the activity hub with connectivity to existing transit systems, and (2) the robust route scheduling step which determines the vehicle assignment and route headway under demand uncertainty. Efficient exact and heuristic algorithms are developed for identifying the minimum number of routes that maximize passenger coverage, and a matching scheme is proposed to combine routes to and from the hub into roundtrips optimally. With the generated routes, the robust route scheduling problem is formulated as a two-stage robust optimization problem. Model reformulations are introduced to solve the robust optimization problem into the global optimum. In this regard, the proposed framework presents both algorithmic and analytic solutions for developing the hub-based transit services in response to the varying passenger demand over a short-time period. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, comprehensive numerical experiments are conducted for planning the HHMoD services at the JFK airport in New York City (NYC). The results show the superior performance of the proposed route generation algorithm to maximize the citywide coverage more efficiently. The results also demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of the robust route schedules under normal demand conditions and against worst-case-oriented realizations of passenger demand.",

      "abstract": "Scientific workflow management systems (SWMSs) and resource managers together ensure that tasks are scheduled on provisioned resources so that all dependencies are obeyed, and some optimization goal, such as makespan minimization, is achieved. In practice, however, there is no clear separation of scheduling responsibilities between an SWMS and a resource manager because there exists no agreed-upon separation of concerns between their different components. This has two consequences. First, the lack of a standardized API to exchange scheduling information between SWMSs and resource managers hinders portability. It incurs costly adaptations when a component should be replaced by a different one (e.g., an SWMS with another SWMS on the same resource manager). Second, due to overlapping functionalities, current installations often actually have two schedulers, both making partial scheduling decisions under incomplete information, leading to suboptimal workflow scheduling.   In this paper, we propose a simple REST interface between SWMSs and resource managers, which allows any SWMS to pass dynamic workflow information to a resource manager, enabling maximally informed scheduling decisions. We provide an implementation of this API as an example, using Nextflow as an SWMS and Kubernetes as a resource manager. Our experiments with nine real-world workflows show that this strategy reduces makespan by up to 25.1% and 10.8% on average compared to the standard Nextflow/Kubernetes configuration. Furthermore, a more widespread implementation of this API would enable leaner code bases, a simpler exchange of components of workflow systems, and a unified place to implement new scheduling algorithms.",

      "abstract": "Congestion control is vastly important in computer networks. Arising naturally from the bursty nature of Internet traffic, congestion plagues not only the network edge, but also the network core. Many remedies have been proposed to fight congestion; active queue management (AQM) is one such proposal. AQM seeks to prevent congestion by actively avoiding it. Some queuing disciplines such as Random Early Detection (RED) will prematurely drop a random packet (with some probability) when the queue nears capacity to signal the sender to back off. However, RED utilizes queue length as a mechanism to indicate congestion. On the other hand, the Controlled Delay (CoDel) queuing discipline uses queuing delay as an indication of congestion. The problem with both RED and CoDel are that they indiscriminately treat all packets the same. Normally implemented using a FIFO queue, CoDel simply enqueues and dequeues packets in a first-come, first-served manner. Priority queuing can be carefully utilized to selectively service packets utilizing the very same metric CoDel uses for AQM, queuing delay. That said, Least Slack Time First (LSTF), a multi-processor scheduling algorithm employs priority scheduling, which coincidentally, is also based on delay. In the context of computer networks LSTF can be applied in the control plane or in the data plane. At the control plane, LSTF functions across the entire network, but in doing so requires all intermediary routers to implement it; LSTF also requires support at the packet level in terms of a slack entry. Within the data plane, LSTF can be implemented as a queuing mechanism based on delay spent in the router (just like CoDel AQM). This paper applies data plane level LSTF to CoDel AQM to enable delay-based packet classification within the confines of the CoDel AQM algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The emerging technology of the Autonomous Truck Mounted Attenuator (ATMA), a leader-follower style vehicle system, utilizes connected and automated vehicle capabilities to enhance safety during transportation infrastructure maintenance in work zones. However, the speed difference between ATMA vehicles and general vehicles creates a moving bottleneck that reduces capacity and increases queue length, resulting in additional delays. The different routes taken by ATMA cause diverse patterns of time-varying capacity drops, which may affect the user equilibrium traffic assignment and lead to different system costs. This manuscript focuses on optimizing the routing for ATMA vehicles in a network to minimize the system cost associated with the slow-moving operation.   To achieve this, a queuing-based traffic assignment approach is proposed to identify the system cost caused by the ATMA system. A queuing-based time-dependent (QBTD) travel time function, considering capacity drop, is introduced and applied in the static user equilibrium traffic assignment problem, with a result of adding dynamic characteristics. Subsequently, we formulate the queuing-based traffic assignment problem and solve it using a modified path-based algorithm. The methodology is validated using a small-size and a large-size network and compared with two benchmark models to analyze the benefit of capacity drop modeling and QBTD travel time function. Furthermore, the approach is applied to quantify the impact of different routes on the traffic system and identify an optimal route for ATMA vehicles performing maintenance work. Finally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to explore how the impact changes with variations in traffic demand and capacity reduction.",

Task scheduling is an NP-hard problem that is considered one of the main critical challenges in a heterogeneous VCS. Due to this, in this paper, we design two task scheduling algorithms for VCSs, named Min-CCV and Min-V.

Our extensive simulation results show that proposed algorithms are able to allocate tasks to volunteer fog/cloud resources more efficiently than the state-of-the-art.

By introducing optimization models and heuristic algorithms, the scheduling strategy is comprehensively improved, and experimental verification is carried out using the real Google Cluster Data dataset. The experimental results show that compared with traditional static rule algorithms and heuristic algorithms, the optimized scheduling scheme shows significant advantages in resource utilization, load balancing and burst task completion efficiency. This shows that the proposed method can effectively improve resource management efficiency and ensure service quality and system stability in complex dynamic cloud environments.

The machine has two states, namely, a busy state and a free state. The server can assign a job to the machine in a first-in-first-served manner. If the machine is free, it completes the job request from the server; otherwise, it drops the request. Upon dropping a job request, the server is penalized. When the machine is in the free state, the machine can get into the busy state with an internal job. When the server does not assign a job request to the machine, the state of the machine evolves as a symmetric Markov chain. If the machine successfully accepts the job request from the server, the state of the machine goes to the busy state and follows a different dynamics compared to the dynamics when the machine goes to the busy state due to an internal job. The sampler samples the state of the machine and sends it to the server via an error-free channel. Thus, the server can estimate the state of the machine, upon receiving an update from the source. If the machine is in the free state but the estimated state at the server is busy, the sampler pays a cost. We incorporate the concept of the age of incorrect information to model the cost of the sampler. We aim to find an optimal sampling policy such that the cost of the sampler plus the penalty on the machine gets minimized. We formulate this problem in a Markov decision process framework and find how an optimal policy changes with several associated parameters. We show that a threshold policy is optimal for this problem. We show a necessary and sufficient condition for a threshold policy to be optimal.

In many cases, formulating such problems necessitates making simplistic assumptions on arrival and departure processes to keep the problem simple. This work puts forth a stochastic optimization framework for designing queuing systems where the exogenous processes may have arbitrary and unknown distributions. We show that many such queuing design problems can generally be formulated as stochastic optimization problems where the objective and constraint are non-linear functions of expectations. The compositional structure obviates the use of classical stochastic approximation approaches where the stochastic gradients are often required to be unbiased. To this end, a constrained stochastic compositional gradient descent algorithm is proposed that utilizes a tracking step for the expected value functions. The non-asymptotic performance of the proposed algorithm is characterized via its iteration complexity.

The proposed method establishes a multi-agricultural machinery task allocation model by combining the path pre-planning of a simulated annealing algorithm and the static task allocation of a genetic algorithm. By sequentially fusing these two algorithms, their respective shortcomings can be overcome, and their advantages in global and local search can be utilised. Consequently, the search capability of the population is enhanced, leading to the discovery of more optimal solutions. Then, an adaptive crossover operator is constructed according to the task assignment model, considering the capacity, path cost, and time of agricultural machinery; two-segment coding and multi-population adaptive mutation are used to assign tasks to improve the diversity of the population and enhance the exploration ability of the population; and to improve the global optimisation ability of the hybrid algorithm, a 2-Opt local optimisation operator and an Circle modification algorithm are introduced. Finally, simulation experiments were conducted in MATLAB to evaluate the performance of the multi-agricultural machinery collaborative task assignment based on the improved genetic hybrid algorithm. The algorithm's capabilities were assessed through comparative analysis in the simulation trials. The results demonstrate that the developed hybrid algorithm can effectively reduce path costs, and the efficiency of the assignment outcomes surpasses that of the classical genetic algorithm. This approach proves particularly suitable for addressing large-scale task allocation problems.",

      "abstract": "Flowshop machine scheduling has been of main interest in several applications where the timing of its processes plays a fundamental role in the utilization of system resources. Addressing the optimal sequencing of the jobs when equivalent failures across machines exist is a decision of particular relevance to the general scheduling problem. Such failures allow for unpredictable time consumption and improper utilization of the machines. Therefore, it is of particular relevance to address the problem with new modeling approaches considering the parallel and sequential components of the manufacturing process under equivalent failure in the jobs at each machine. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain to model the N/ M/P/F permutation flowshop. We analyze the time cost encountered due to M consecutive machine equivalent failures in processing N jobs. We derive new closed form expressions of the completion time under such setup. We extend the Markov model into its underlying components, providing another new Markov model with processes that dont encounter failures and compare both systems. We provide new insights on job ordering decision rules and new approaches in a set of proposed algorithms that provide novel optimal and heuristic methods that provides optimal or near optimal schedules. We derive closed form expressions that divide per machine CT and per machine processing and waiting times. Further, we provide a novel scheme that proves intimate connections between such time components and the maximum number of rounds per machine that allows optimal utilization of the machines in one CT.",

Stochastic scheduling for several interdependent infrastructure systems is a difficult control problem with huge decision spaces. The Markov decision process (MDP)-based optimization approach proposed in this study incorporates different sources of uncertainties to compute the restoration policies. The computation of optimal scheduling schemes using our method employs the rollout algorithm, which provides an effective computational tool for optimization problems dealing with real-world large-scale networks and communities. We apply the proposed methodology to a realistic community recovery problem, where different decision-making objectives are considered. Our approach accommodates current restoration strategies employed in recovery management. Our computational results indicate that the restoration policies calculated using our techniques significantly outperform the current recovery strategies.

There are constraints on which queues can be served simultaneously. This model effectively describes important special instances like network switches, interference in wireless networks, bandwidth sharing for congestion control and traffic scheduling in road roundabouts. Fair scheduling is required because it provides isolation to different traffic flows; isolation makes the system more robust and enables providing quality of service. Existing work on fairness for constrained networks concentrates on flow based fairness. As a main result, we describe a notion of packet based fairness by establishing an analogy with the ranked election problem: packets are voters, schedules are candidates and each packet ranks the schedules based on its priorities. We then obtain a scheduling algorithm that achieves the described notion of fairness by drawing upon the seminal work of Goodman and Markowitz (1952). This yields the familiar Maximum Weight (MW) style algorithm. As another important result we prove that algorithm obtained is throughput optimal. There is no reason a priori why this should be true, and the proof requires non-traditional methods.",

We propose a general and scalable framework to optimize real-time systems, named Numerical Optimizer with Real-Time Highlight (NORTH). NORTH is built upon the gradient-based active-set methods from the numerical optimization literature but with new methods to manage active constraints for the non-differentiable schedulability constraints. In addition, we also generalize NORTH to NORTH+, to collaboratively optimize certain types of discrete variables (e.g., priority assignments, categorical variables) with continuous variables based on numerical optimization algorithms. We demonstrate the algorithm performance with two example applications: energy minimization based on dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), and optimization of control system performance. In these experiments, NORTH achieved $10^2$ to $10^5$ times speed improvements over state-of-the-art methods while maintaining similar or better solution quality. NORTH+ outperforms NORTH by 30% with similar algorithm scalability. Both NORTH and NORTH+ support black-box schedulability analysis, ensuring broad applicability.",

This paper studies a novel device-to-device (D2D)-enabled multi-helper MEC system, in which a local user solicits its nearby WDs serving as helpers for cooperative computation. We assume a time division multiple access (TDMA) transmission protocol, under which the local user offloads the tasks to multiple helpers and downloads the results from them over orthogonal pre-scheduled time slots. Under this setup, we minimize the computation latency by optimizing the local user's task assignment jointly with the time and rate for task offloading and results downloading, as well as the computation frequency for task execution, subject to individual energy and computation capacity constraints at the local user and the helpers. However, the formulated problem is a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) that is difficult to solve. To tackle this challenge, we propose an efficient algorithm by first relaxing the original problem into a convex one, and then constructing a suboptimal task assignment solution based on the obtained optimal one. Next, we consider a benchmark scheme that endows the WDs with their maximum computation capacities. To further reduce the implementation complexity, we also develop a heuristic scheme based on the greedy task assignment. Finally, numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, as compared against the heuristic scheme and other benchmark ones without either joint optimization of radio and computation resources or task assignment design.",

To this end, we employ queues to model the system congestion of drone requests and consider three queuing disciplines: non-priority, static priority, and dynamic priority.

We model the decision process of the task scheduler as a semi-Markov decision problem (SMDP). Then, to solve the formulated SMDP, we propose two reinforcement learning algorithms that are capable of computing the optimal task assignment policy without requiring the statistical knowledge of the stochastic dynamics underlying the system states. The proposed algorithms also rely on function approximation techniques to handle the infinite length of the task queue as well as the continuous nature of temperature readings.

The users are assigned to resource blocks. A transmission may use multiple resource blocks scheduled over frequency and time. In our model, we use logarithmic and sigmoidal-like utility functions to represent the users applications running on different user equipments (UE)s. We present an optimal problem with utility proportional fairness policy, where the fairness among users is in utility percentage (i.e user satisfaction with the service) of the corresponding applications. Our objective is to allocate the resources to the users with priority given to the adaptive real-time application users. In addition, a minimum resource allocation for users with elastic and inelastic traffic should be guaranteed. Every user subscribing for the mobile service should have a minimum quality-of-service (QoS) with a priority criterion. We prove that our scheduling policy exists and achieves the maximum. Therefore the optimal solution is tractable. We present a centralized scheduling algorithm to allocate evolved NodeB (eNodeB) resources optimally with a priority criterion. Finally, we present simulation results for the performance of our scheduling algorithm and compare our results with conventional proportional fairness approaches. The results show that the user satisfaction is higher with our proposed method.",

Specifically, given a multi-stage pipeline with multiple heterogeneous resources of the same type at each stage, the problem is to assign priorities to a set of real-time jobs with different release times to access a resource at each stage of the pipeline subject to the end-to-end deadline constraints. Note, in such a system, jobs may compete with different sets of jobs at different stages of the pipeline depending on the job-to-resource mapping. To this end, following are the two major contributions of this work. We show that an OPA-compatible schedulability test based on the delay composition algebra can be constructed, which we then use with an optimal priority assignment algorithm to compute a priority ordering. Further, we establish the versatility of pairwise priority assignment in such a multi-stage multi-resource system, compared to a total priority ordering. In particular, we show that a pairwise priority assignment may be feasible even if a priority ordering does not exist. We propose an integer linear programming formulation and a scalable heuristic to compute a pairwise priority assignment. We also show through simulation experiments that the proposed approaches can be used for the holistic scheduling of real-time jobs in edge computing systems.",

Scheduling in edge-cloud environments can address the high complexity problem of workflow applications, while decreasing the data transmission delay between the cloud and end devices. However, because of the heterogeneous resources in edge-cloud environments and the complicated data dependencies among the tasks in a workflow, significant challenges for workflow scheduling remain, including the selection of an optimal tasks-servers solution from the possible numerous combinations. The existing studies have been mainly done subject to rigorous conditions without fluctuations, ignoring the fact that workflow scheduling is typically present in uncertain environments. In this study, we focus on reducing the execution cost of workflow applications mainly caused by task computation and data transmission, while satisfying the workflow deadline in uncertain edge-cloud environments. The Triangular Fuzzy Numbers (TFNs) are adopted to represent the task processing time and data transferring time. A cost-driven fuzzy scheduling strategy based on an Adaptive Discrete Particle Swarm Optimization (ADPSO) algorithm is proposed, which employs the operators of Genetic Algorithm (GA). This strategy introduces the randomly two-point crossover operator, neighborhood mutation operator, and adaptive multipoint mutation operator of GA to effectively avoid converging on local optima. The experimental results show that our strategy can effectively reduce the workflow execution cost in uncertain edge-cloud environments, compared with other benchmark solutions.",

Efficient scheduler designs for such clusters are vital to reduce operational costs and enhance resource utilization. While recent schedulers have shown impressive performance in optimizing DL job performance and cluster utilization through periodic reallocation or selection of GPU resources, they also encounter challenges such as preemption and migration overhead, along with potential DL accuracy degradation. Nonetheless, few explore the potential benefits of GPU sharing to improve resource utilization and reduce job queuing times. Motivated by these insights, we present a job scheduling model allowing multiple jobs to share the same set of GPUs without altering job training settings. We introduce SJF-BSBF (shortest job first with best sharing benefit first), a straightforward yet effective heuristic scheduling algorithm. SJF-BSBF intelligently selects job pairs for GPU resource sharing and runtime settings (sub-batch size and scheduling time point) to optimize overall performance while ensuring DL convergence accuracy through gradient accumulation. In experiments with both physical DL workloads and trace-driven simulations, even as a preemption-free policy, SJF-BSBF reduces the average job completion time by 27-33\\% relative to the state-of-the-art preemptive DL schedulers. Moreover, SJF-BSBF can wisely determine the optimal resource sharing settings, such as the sharing time point and sub-batch size for gradient accumulation, outperforming the aggressive GPU sharing approach (baseline SJF-FFS policy) by up to 17\\% in large-scale traces.",

The focus of this research is to efficiently optimize resource allocation in the cloud by exploiting the Max-Min scheduling algorithm and enhancing it to increase efficiency in terms of completion time (makespan). This is key to enhancing the performance of cloud scheduling and narrowing the performance gap between cloud service providers and cloud resources consumers/users. The current Max-Min algorithm selects tasks with maximum execution time on a faster available machine or resource that is capable of giving minimum completion time. The concern of this algorithm is to give priority to tasks with maximum execution time first before assigning those with the minimum execution time for the purpose of minimizing makespan. The drawback of this algorithm is that, the execution of tasks with maximum execution time first may increase the makespan, and leads to a delay in executing tasks with minimum execution time if the number of tasks with maximum execution time exceeds that of tasks with minimum execution time, hence the need to improve it to mitigate the delay in executing tasks with minimum execution time. CloudSim is used to compare the effectiveness of the improved Max-Min algorithm with the traditional one. The experimented results show that the improved algorithm is efficient and can produce better makespan than Max-Min and DataAware.",

      "abstract": "Federated Learning provides new opportunities for training machine learning models while respecting data privacy. This technique is based on heterogeneous devices that work together to iteratively train a model while never sharing their own data. Given the synchronous nature of this training, the performance of Federated Learning systems is dictated by the slowest devices, also known as stragglers. In this paper, we investigate the problem of minimizing the duration of Federated Learning rounds by controlling how much data each device uses for training. We formulate this problem as a makespan minimization problem with identical, independent, and atomic tasks that have to be assigned to heterogeneous resources with non-decreasing cost functions while respecting lower and upper limits of tasks per resource. Based on this formulation, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm named OLAR and prove that it provides optimal schedules. We evaluate OLAR in an extensive experimental evaluation using simulation that includes comparisons to other algorithms from the state of the art and new extensions to them. Our results indicate that OLAR provides optimal solutions with a small execution time. They also show that the presence of lower and upper limits of tasks per resource erase any benefits that suboptimal heuristics could provide in terms of algorithm execution time.",

      "abstract": "In classical scheduling problems, we are given jobs and machines, and have to schedule all the jobs to minimize some objective function. What if each job has a specified profit, and we are no longer required to process all jobs -- we can schedule any subset of jobs whose total profit is at least a (hard) target profit requirement, while still approximately minimizing the objective function?   We refer to this class of problems as scheduling with outliers. This model was initiated by Charikar and Khuller (SODA'06) on the minimum max-response time in broadcast scheduling. We consider three other well-studied scheduling objectives: the generalized assignment problem, average weighted completion time, and average flow time, and provide LP-based approximation algorithms for them. For the minimum average flow time problem on identical machines, we give a logarithmic approximation algorithm for the case of unit profits based on rounding an LP relaxation; we also show a matching integrality gap. For the average weighted completion time problem on unrelated machines, we give a constant factor approximation. The algorithm is based on randomized rounding of the time-indexed LP relaxation strengthened by the knapsack-cover inequalities. For the generalized assignment problem with outliers, we give a simple reduction to GAP without outliers to obtain an algorithm whose makespan is within 3 times the optimum makespan, and whose cost is at most (1 + \\epsilon) times the optimal cost.",
