      "abstract": "Network interdiction problems are combinatorial optimization problems involving two players: one aims to solve an optimization problem on a network, while the other seeks to modify the network to thwart the first player's objectives. Such problems typically emerge in an attacker-defender context, encompassing areas such as military operations, disease spread analysis, and communication network management. The primary bottleneck in network interdiction arises from the high time complexity of using conventional exact solvers and the challenges associated with devising efficient heuristic solvers. GNNs, recognized as a cutting-edge methodology, have shown significant effectiveness in addressing single-level CO problems on graphs, such as the traveling salesman problem, graph matching, and graph edit distance. Nevertheless, network interdiction presents a bi-level optimization challenge, which current GNNs find difficult to manage. To address this gap, we represent network interdiction problems as Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) instances, then apply a multipartite GNN with sufficient representational capacity to learn these formulations. This approach ensures that our neural network is more compatible with the mathematical algorithms designed to solve network interdiction problems, resulting in improved generalization. Through two distinct tasks, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms theoretical baseline models and provides advantages over traditional exact solvers.",

      "abstract": "Traditional network interdiction refers to the problem of an interdictor trying to reduce the throughput of network users by removing network edges. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for network interdiction that models scenarios, such as stealth DoS attack, where the interdiction is performed through injecting adversarial traffic flows. Under this paradigm, we first study the deterministic flow interdiction problem, where the interdictor has perfect knowledge of the operation of network users. We show that the problem is highly inapproximable on general networks and is NP-hard even when the network is acyclic. We then propose an algorithm that achieves a logarithmic approximation ratio and quasi-polynomial time complexity for acyclic networks through harnessing the submodularity of the problem. Next, we investigate the robust flow interdiction problem, which adopts the robust optimization framework to capture the case where definitive knowledge of the operation of network users is not available. We design an approximation framework that integrates the aforementioned algorithm, yielding a quasi-polynomial time procedure with poly-logarithmic approximation ratio for the more challenging robust flow interdiction. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through simulations, showing that they can be efficiently implemented and yield near-optimal solutions.",

      "abstract": "Shortest path network interdiction is a combinatorial optimization problem on an activity network arising in a number of important security-related applications. It is classically formulated as a bilevel maximin problem representing an \"interdictor\" and an \"evader\". The evader tries to move from a source node to the target node along a path of the least cost while the interdictor attempts to frustrate this motion by cutting edges or nodes. The interdiction objective is to find the optimal set of edges to cut given that there is a finite interdiction budget and the interdictor must move first. We reformulate the interdiction problem for stochastic evaders by introducing a model in which the evader follows a Markovian random walk guided by the least-cost path to the target. This model can represent incomplete knowledge about the evader, and the resulting model is a nonlinear 0-1 optimization problem. We then introduce an optimization heuristic based on betweenness centrality that can rapidly find high-quality interdiction solutions by providing a global view of the network.",

      "abstract": "This manuscript describes the notions of blocker and interdiction applied to well-known optimization problems. The main interest of these two concepts is the capability to analyze the existence of a combinatorial structure after some modifications. We focus on graph modification, like removing vertices or links in a network. In the interdiction version, we have a budget for modification to reduce as much as possible the size of a given combinatorial structure. Whereas, for the blocker version, we minimize the number of modifications such that the network does not contain a given combinatorial structure. Blocker and interdiction problems have some similarities and can be applied to well-known optimization problems. We consider matching, connectivity, shortest path, max flow, and clique problems. For these problems, we analyze either the blocker version or the interdiction one. Applying the concept of blocker or interdiction to well-known optimization problems can change their complexities. Some optimization problems become harder when one of these two notions is applied. For this reason, we propose some complexity analysis to show when an optimization problem, or the associated decision problem, becomes harder. Another fundamental aspect developed in the manuscript is the use of exact methods to tackle these optimization problems. The main way to solve these problems is to use integer linear programming to model them. An interesting aspect of integer linear programming is the possibility to analyze theoretically the strength of these models, using cutting planes. For most of the problems studied in this manuscript, a polyhedral analysis is performed to prove the strength of inequalities or describe new families of inequalities. The exact algorithms proposed are based on Branch-and-Cut or Branch-and-Price algorithm, where dedicated separation and pricing algorithms are proposed.",

      "abstract": "Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is widely used to account for the preferences of a risk-averse agent in the extreme loss scenarios. To study the effectiveness of randomization in interdiction games with an interdictor that is both risk and ambiguity averse, we introduce a distributionally robust network interdiction game where the interdictor randomizes over the feasible interdiction plans in order to minimize the worst-case CVaR of the flow with respect to both the unknown distribution of the capacity of the arcs and his mixed strategy over interdicted arcs. The flow player, on the contrary, maximizes the total flow in the network. By using the budgeted uncertainty set, we control the degree of conservatism in the model and reformulate the interdictor's non-linear problem as a bi-convex optimization problem. For solving this problem to any given optimality level, we devise a spatial branch and bound algorithm that uses the McCormick inequalities and reduced reformulation linearization technique (RRLT) to obtain convex relaxation of the problem. We also develop a column generation algorithm to identify the optimal support of the convex relaxation which is then used in the coordinate descent algorithm to determine the upper bounds. The efficiency and convergence of the spatial branch and bound algorithm is established in the numerical experiments. Further, our numerical experiments show that randomized strategies can have significantly better in-sample and out-of-sample performance than optimal deterministic ones.",

As a starting point, we focus on decentralized shortest path interdiction (DSPI) games, where multiple interdictors try to increase the shortest path lengths of their own adversaries, who all attempt to traverse a common network. We first establish results regarding the existence of equilibria for DSPI games under both discrete and continuous interdiction strategies. To compute such an equilibrium, we present a reformulation of the DSPI games, which leads to a generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) with non-shared constraints. While such a problem is computationally challenging in general, we show that under continuous interdiction actions, a DSPI game can be formulated as a linear complementarity problem and solved by Lemke's algorithm. In addition, we present decentralized heuristic algorithms based on best response dynamics for games under both continuous and discrete interdiction strategies. Finally, we establish theoretical bounds on the worst-case efficiency loss of equilibria in DSPI games, with such loss caused by the lack of coordination among noncooperative interdictors, and use the decentralized algorithms to empirically study the average-case efficiency loss.",

We consider a boundedly rational adversary in which the adversary's response model is based on a dynamic form of classic logit-based discrete choice models. We show that the problem of finding an optimal interdiction strategy for the defender in the rational setting is NP-hard. The resulting optimization is in fact non-convex and additionally, involves complex terms that sum over exponentially many paths. We tackle these computational challenges by presenting new efficient approximation algorithms with bounded solution guarantees. First, we address the exponentially-many-path challenge by proposing a polynomial-time dynamic programming-based formulation. We then show that the gradient of the non-convex objective can also be computed in polynomial time, which allows us to use a gradient-based method to solve the problem efficiently. Second, we identify a restricted problem that is convex and hence gradient-based methods find the global optimal solution for this restricted problem. We further identify mild conditions under which this restricted problem provides a bounded approximation for the original problem.",

In this problem, a defender interdicts arcs on a directed graph to minimize an attacker's probability of undetected traversal through the network. The attacker's origin and destination are unknown to the defender and assumed to be random. SNIP can be formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer program via a deterministic equivalent formulation (DEF). As the size of this DEF makes it impractical for solving large instances, current approaches to solving SNIP rely on modifications of Benders decomposition. We present two new approaches to solve SNIP. First, we introduce a new DEF that is significantly more compact than the standard DEF. Second, we propose a new path-based formulation of SNIP. The number of constraints required to define this formulation grows exponentially with the size of the network, but the model can be solved via delayed constraint generation. We present valid inequalities for this path-based formulation which are dependent on the structure of the interdicted arc probabilities. We propose a branch-and-cut (BC) algorithm to solve this new SNIP formulation. Computational results demonstrate that directly solving the more compact SNIP formulation and this BC algorithm both provide an improvement over a state-of-the-art implementation of Benders decomposition for this problem.",

We initiate the algorithmic study of $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts which, given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, two specified vertices $s,t \\in V$, and an integer $k > 0$, asks for a collection of $k$ minimum $s$-$t$ cuts in $G$ that has maximum diversity. We investigate the complexity of the problem for maximizing three diversity measures that can be applied to a collection of cuts: (i) the sum of all pairwise Hamming distances, (ii) the cardinality of the union of cuts in the collection, and (iii) the minimum pairwise Hamming distance. We prove that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts can be solved in strongly polynomial time for diversity measures (i) and (ii) via submodular function minimization. We obtain this result by establishing a connection between ordered collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts and the theory of distributive lattices. When restricted to finding only collections of mutually disjoint solutions, we provide a more practical algorithm that finds a maximum set of pairwise disjoint minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. For graphs with small minimum $s$-$t$ cut, it runs in the time of a single max-flow computation. Our results stand in contrast to the problem of finding $k$ diverse global minimum cuts -- which is known to be NP-hard even for the disjoint case (Hanaka et al., AAAI'23) -- and partially answer a long-standing open question of Wagner (Networks, 1990) about improving the complexity of finding disjoint collections of minimum $s$-$t$ cuts. Lastly, we show that $k$-Diverse Minimum s-t Cuts subject to diversity measure (iii) is NP-hard already for $k=3$.",

      "abstract": "The interdiction problem arises in a variety of areas including military logistics, infectious disease control, and counter-terrorism. In the typical formulation of network interdiction, the task of the interdictor is to find a set of edges in a weighted network such that the removal of those edges would maximally increase the cost to an evader of traveling on a path through the network.   Our work is motivated by cases in which the evader has incomplete information about the network or lacks planning time or computational power, e.g. when authorities set up roadblocks to catch bank robbers, the criminals do not know all the roadblock locations or the best path to use for their escape.   We introduce a model of network interdiction in which the motion of one or more evaders is described by Markov processes and the evaders are assumed not to react to interdiction decisions. The interdiction objective is to find an edge set of size B, that maximizes the probability of capturing the evaders.   We prove that similar to the standard least-cost formulation for deterministic motion this interdiction problem is also NP-hard. But unlike that problem our interdiction problem is submodular and the optimal solution can be approximated within 1-1/e using a greedy algorithm. Additionally, we exploit submodularity through a priority evaluation strategy that eliminates the linear complexity scaling in the number of network edges and speeds up the solution by orders of magnitude. Taken together the results bring closer the goal of finding realistic solutions to the interdiction problem on global-scale networks.",

Examples include routing packets in a computer network, routing traffic on a transportation network, and inferring semantic distances between concepts on the World Wide Web. An adversary with the capability to perturb the graph might make the shortest path between two nodes route traffic through advantageous portions of the graph (e.g., a toll road he owns). In this paper, we introduce the Force Path Cut problem, in which there is a specific route the adversary wants to promote by removing a minimum number of edges in the graph. We show that Force Path Cut is NP-complete, but also that it can be recast as an instance of the Weighted Set Cover problem, enabling the use of approximation algorithms. The size of the universe for the set cover problem is potentially factorial in the number of nodes. To overcome this hurdle, we propose the PATHATTACK algorithm, which via constraint generation considers only a small subset of paths -- at most 5% of the number of edges in 99% of our experiments. Across a diverse set of synthetic and real networks, the linear programming formulation of Weighted Set Cover yields the optimal solution in over 98% of cases. We also demonstrate a time/cost tradeoff using two approximation algorithms and greedy baseline methods.

      "abstract": "Network interdiction problems are a natural way to study the sensitivity of a network optimization problem with respect to the removal of a limited set of edges or vertices. One of the oldest and best-studied interdiction problems is minimum spanning tree (MST) interdiction. Here, an undirected multigraph with nonnegative edge weights and positive interdiction costs on its edges is given, together with a positive budget B. The goal is to find a subset of edges R, whose total interdiction cost does not exceed B, such that removing R leads to a graph where the weight of an MST is as large as possible. Frederickson and Solis-Oba (SODA 1996) presented an O(log m)-approximation for MST interdiction, where m is the number of edges. Since then, no further progress has been made regarding approximations, and the question whether MST interdiction admits an O(1)-approximation remained open.   We answer this question in the affirmative, by presenting a 14-approximation that overcomes two main hurdles that hindered further progress so far. Moreover, based on a well-known 2-approximation for the metric traveling salesman problem (TSP), we show that our O(1)-approximation for MST interdiction implies an O(1)-approximation for a natural interdiction version of metric TSP.",

The RCDS problem is shown to be NP-hard, even for planar graphs. A mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented. In addition, for planar graphs a fixed parameter polynomial time solution methodology based on sphere-cut decomposition and dynamic programming is presented. The computation cost of the sphere-cut decomposition based approach grows linearly with problem instance size, provided that the branchwidth of the underlying graph is fixed and small. A case study with IEEE benchmark power networks verifies that small branchwidth are not uncommon in practice.

      "abstract": "Network interdiction can be viewed as a game between two players, an \"interdictor\" and a \"flow player\". The flow player wishes to send as much material as possible through a network, while the interdictor attempts to minimize the amount of transported material by removing a certain number of arcs, say $\\Gamma$ arcs. We introduce the randomized network interdiction problem that allows the interdictor to use randomness to select arcs to be removed. We model the problem in two different ways: arc-based and path-based formulations, depending on whether flows are defined on arcs or paths, respectively. We present insights into the modeling power, complexity, and approximability of both formulations. In particular, we prove that $Z_{\\text{NI}}/Z_{\\text{RNI}}\\leq \\Gamma+1$, $Z_{\\text{NI}}/Z_{\\text{RNI}}^{\\text{Path}}\\leq \\Gamma+1$, $Z_{\\text{RNI}}/Z_{\\text{RNI}}^{\\text{Path}}\\leq \\Gamma$, where $Z_{\\text{NI}}$, $Z_{\\text{RNI}}$, and $Z_{\\text{RNI}}^{\\text{Path}}$ are the optimal values of the network interdiction problem and its randomized versions in arc-based and path-based formulations, respectively. We also show that these bounds are tight. We show that it is NP-hard to compute the values $Z_{\\text{RNI}}$ and $Z_{\\text{RNI}}^{\\text{Path}}$ for a general $\\Gamma$, but they are computable in polynomial time when $\\Gamma=1$. Further, we provide a $(\\Gamma+1)$-approximation for $Z_{\\text{NI}}$, a $\\Gamma$-approximation for $Z_{\\text{RNI}}$, and a $\\big(1+\\lfloor \\Gamma/2\\rfloor \\cdot \\lceil \\Gamma/2\\rceil/(\\Gamma+1)\\big)$-approximation for $Z_{\\text{RNI}}^{\\text{Path}}$.",

An adversary that can manipulate the graph structure could alter traffic patterns to gain some benefit (e.g., make more money by directing traffic to a toll road). This paper presents the Force Path Cut problem, in which an adversary removes edges from a graph to make a particular path the shortest between its terminal nodes. We prove that this problem is APX-hard, but introduce PATHATTACK, a polynomial-time approximation algorithm that guarantees a solution within a logarithmic factor of the optimal value. In addition, we introduce the Force Edge Cut and Force Node Cut problems, in which the adversary targets a particular edge or node, respectively, rather than an entire path. We derive a nonconvex optimization formulation for these problems, and derive a heuristic algorithm that uses PATHATTACK as a subroutine. We demonstrate all of these algorithms on a diverse set of real and synthetic networks, illustrating the network types that benefit most from the proposed algorithms.",

Valid inequalities used as cutting planes in branch-and-bound algorithms have been instrumental in solving large-scale instances.

These are the metric inequalities for projecting out continuous flow variables, mixed-integer rounding from appropriate base relaxations and shrinking the network to a small $k$-node graph. The basic inequalities derived from arc-set, cut-set and partition relaxations of the network are also extensively utilized with certain modifications in robust and survivable network design problems.",

The CPMC problem is a rather powerful formulation for a set of problems and finds applications in many other areas, such as network security, image processing, data mining, pattern recognition, and machine learning. For this important problem, we consider two variants, connectiv- ity preserving minimum node cut (CPMNC) and connectivity preserving minimum edge cut (CPMEC). For CPMNC, we show that it cannot be ap- proximated within {\\alpha}logn for some constant {\\alpha} unless P=NP, and cannot be approximated within any poly(logn) unless NP has quasi-polynomial time algorithms. The hardness results hold even for graphs with unit weight and bipartite graphs. Particularly, we show that polynomial time solutions exist for CPMEC in planar graphs and for CPMNC in some special planar graphs. The hardness of CPMEC in general graphs remains open, but the polynomial time algorithm in planar graphs still has important practical applications.",

      "abstract": "We consider the problem of secure packet routing at the maximum achievable rate in Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) networks. Assume that a QKD protocol generates symmetric private key pairs for secure communication over each link in a network. The quantum key generation process is modeled using a stochastic counting process. Packets are first encrypted with the quantum keys available for each hop and then transmitted on a point-to-point basis over the links. A fundamental problem in this setting is the design of a secure and capacity-achieving routing policy that takes into account the time-varying availability of the encryption keys and finite link capacities. In this paper, we propose a new secure throughput-optimal policy called Tandem Queue Decomposition (TQD). The TQD policy is derived by combining the QKD process with the Universal Max Weight routing policy, proposed earlier by Sinha and Modiano. We show that the TQD policy solves the problem of secure and efficient packet routing for a broad class of traffic, including unicast, broadcast, multicast, and anycast. The proposed decomposition reduces the problem to the generalized network flow problem without the key availability constraints over a transformed network. The proof of the throughput-optimality of the TQD policy uses the Lyapunov stability theory for analyzing the interdependent packet queueing process and the key-storage dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate the competitiveness of the TQD policy over the existing algorithms by numerically comparing them on a simulator that we build on top of the state-of-the-art OMNeT++ network simulator platform.",

This problem is modeled as a bilevel mixed integer linear program (BMILP), and is solved using column-and-constraint generation with partial information. We also simplify the BMILP when all interdictions are implemented before the network is operated. Modeling-based augmentations are proposed to significantly improve the solution time in a majority of instances tested.

      "abstract": "Due to its broad applications in practice, the minimum spanning tree problem and its all kinds of variations have been studied extensively during the last decades, for which a host of efficient exact and heuristic algorithms have been proposed. Meanwhile, motivated by realistic applications, the minimum spanning tree problem in stochastic network has attracted considerable attention of researchers, with respect to which stochastic and robust spanning tree models and related algorithms have been continuingly developed. However, all of them would be either too restricted by the types of the edge weight random variables or computationally intractable, especially in large-scale networks. In this paper, we introduce a target-based distributionally robust optimization framework to solve the minimum spanning tree problem in stochastic graphs where the probability distribution function of the edge weight is unknown but some statistical information could be utilized to prevent the optimal solution from being too conservative. We propose two exact algorithms to solve it, based on Benders decomposition framework and a modified classical greedy algorithm of MST problem (Prim algorithm),respectively. Compared with the NP-hard stochastic and robust spanning tree problems,The proposed target-based distributionally robust minimum spanning tree problem enjoys more satisfactory algorithmic aspect and robustness, when faced with uncertainty in input data.",

More precisely, we address the problem of deploying the minimum number of dedicated sensors, i.e., those measuring a single state variable, that ensure the network to be structurally observable under disruptive scenarios. The disruptive scenarios considered are as follows: (i) the malfunction/loss of one arbitrary sensor, and (ii) the failure of connection (either unidirectional or bidirectional communication) between a pair of agents. First, we show these problems to be NP-hard, which implies that efficient algorithms to determine a solution are unlikely to exist. Secondly, we propose an intuitive two step approach: (1) we achieve an arbitrary minimum sensor placement ensuring structural observability; (2) we develop a sequential process to find minimum number of additional sensors required for robust observability. This step can be solved by recasting it as a weighted set covering problem. Although this is known to be an NP-hard problem, feasible approximations can be determined in polynomial-time that can be used to obtain feasible approximations to the robust structural design problems with optimality guarantees.",

One well-studied branch of network design models ad hoc networks where each node can either operate at high or low power.

Our dual-based approach gives a $3/2$-approximation to DPA, improving the previous best approximation known of $11/7\\approx 1.57$.   Another standard network design problem is Minimum Strongly Connected Spanning Subgraph (MSCS). We propose a new problem generalizing MSCS and DPA called Star Strong Connectivity (SSC).

In this work, we introduce interdiction games whose objective is a monotone and submodular set function. Given a ground set of items, the leader interdicts the usage of some of the items of the follower in order to minimize the objective value achievable by the follower, who seeks to maximize a submodular set function over the uninterdicted items subject to knapsack constraints.   We propose an exact branch-and-cut algorithm for these kind of interdiction games. The algorithm is based on interdiction cuts which allow to capture the follower's objective function value for a given interdiction decision of the leader and exploit the submodularity of the objective function. We also present extensions and liftings of these cuts and discuss additional preprocessing procedures.   We test our solution framework on the weighted maximal covering interdiction game and the bipartite inference interdiction game. For both applications, the improved variants of our interdiction cut perform significantly better than its basic version. For the weighted maximal covering interdiction game for which a mixed-integer bilevel linear programming (MIBLP) formulation is available, we compare the results with those of a state-of-the-art MIBLP solver. While the MIBLP solver yields a minimum of 54% optimality gap within one hour, our best branch-and-cut setting solves all but 4 of 108 instances to optimality with a maximum of 3% gap among unsolved ones.",

Therefore, the objective of this research work is to develop an efficient, two stage optimization strategy for solving this problem. In the first stage, a DC expansion planning problem is solved which provides an initial guess as well as some very good heuristics to reduce the number of power flow solutions for the second stage of AC transmission and reactive expansion planning.

Static AC TNEP results for Garver 6 bus, IEEE 24 bus and IEEE 118 bus test systems have been obtained with the proposed and rigorous approaches and wherever possible, compared with similar results reported in literature to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method.

In the first approach, we transform the MTC problem to a minimum set cover (MSC) problem and use the greedy algorithm that exploits the submodularity property of the MSC problem to compute the solution to the MTC problem. In the second approach, we develop a new \\textit{augmented greedy} algorithm for solving the MTC problem. This approach does not require the transformation of the MTC to MSC. Our augmented greedy algorithm provides in a significant computational improvement while guaranteeing the same approximation ratio as the first approach.

The algorithm can be implemented in polynomial time in the special case where maximal chain probabilities are affine functions of their elements. This existence problem is relevant for the equilibrium characterization of a generic strategic interdiction game on a capacitated flow network. The game involves a routing entity that sends its flow through the network while facing path transportation costs, and an interdictor who simultaneously interdicts one or more edges while facing edge interdiction costs. Using our existence result on posets and strict complementary slackness in linear programming, we show that the Nash equilibria of this game can be fully described using primal and dual solutions of a minimum-cost circulation problem. Our analysis provides a new characterization of the critical components in the interdiction game. It also leads to a polynomial-time approach for equilibrium computation.",

Location theory has been the traditional, centralized approach to study content replication: computing the number and placement of replicas in a static network can be cast as a facility location problem. The endeavor of this work is to design a practical solution to the above joint optimization problem that is suitable for mobile wireless environments. We thus seek a replication algorithm that is lightweight, distributed, and reactive to network dynamics. We devise a solution that lets nodes (i) share the burden of storing and providing content, so as to achieve load balancing, and (ii) autonomously decide whether to replicate or drop the information, so as to adapt the content availability to dynamic demands and time-varying network topologies. We evaluate our mechanism through simulation, by exploring a wide range of settings, including different node mobility models, content characteristics and system scales. Furthermore, we compare our mechanism to state-of-the-art approaches to content delivery in static and mobile networks. Results show that our mechanism, which uses local measurements only, is: (i) extremely precise in approximating an optimal solution to content placement and replication; (ii) robust against network mobility; (iii) flexible in accommodating various content access patterns. Moreover, our scheme outperforms alternative approaches to content dissemination both in terms of content access delay and access congestion.",

In the absence of traffic in the network, the criminal/attacker tries to escape from the city using any of the shortest paths from the crime scene to any randomly chosen exit point. In the presence of traffic, the attacker chooses the optimal path, which takes minimum time to reach his destination. On the contrary, police/defenders try to interdict the criminal on his escape route. This is a challenging task for police with limited resources. Again, a real city road network is also complex in nature. First, we develop a simulation-based model for the optimal allocation of resources using the SUMO simulator. Next, we focus on developing a more advanced search strategy like routing with optimal resource allocation. We develop a novel meta-heuristic approach in a simulation environment to interdict the attacker in a dynamic crime scenario. Like the previous approach, the attacker follows the path with optimal time to escape from the city. In contrast, defenders try to catch the attacker regardless of the path which the attacker takes. The defenders aim is to maximize the interdiction probability. As time plays a vital role, we choose a meta-heuristic approach to provide quality solutions in a time-efficient manner. We test the developed meta-heuristic with a case study on the IIT Kharagpur map, India. We analyze the performance of the mentioned approaches using the SUMO simulator both in the presence of traffic and without traffic. We develop a linear regression model to generate optimal path in the presence of traffic. Here traffic is generated randomly in the whole network using the SUMO simulator.",

The problem is formulated as a zero-sum game between an attacker and a detector. The attacker's decision is to select $f$ nodes of the network to attack whereas the detector's decision is to place $f$ sensors to detect the presence of the attack signals. In our formulation, the attacker minimizes its visibility, defined as the system $L_2$ gain from the attack signals to the deployed sensors' outputs, and the detector maximizes the visibility of the attack signals. The equilibrium strategy of the game determines the optimal locations of the sensors. The existence of Nash equilibrium for the attacker-detector game is studied when the underlying connectivity graph is a directed or an undirected tree. When the game does not admit a Nash equilibrium, it is shown that the Stackelberg equilibrium of the game, with the detector as the game leader, can be computed efficiently. Finally, the attacker-detector game is studied in a cooperative adaptive cruise control algorithm for vehicle platooning problem. The existence of Nash equilibrium is investigated for both directed and undirected platoons and the effect of the position of the reference vehicle on the game value is studied. Our results show that, under the optimal sensor placement strategy, an undirected topology provides a higher security level for a networked control system compared with its corresponding directed topology.",

      "abstract": "Neural networks (NNs), despite their success and wide adoption, still struggle to extrapolate out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., to inputs that are not well-represented by their training dataset. Addressing the OOD generalization gap is crucial when models are deployed in environments significantly different from the training set, such as applying Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) trained on small graphs to large, real-world graphs. One promising approach for achieving robust OOD generalization is the framework of neural algorithmic alignment, which incorporates ideas from classical algorithms by designing neural architectures that resemble specific algorithmic paradigms (e.g. dynamic programming). The hope is that trained models of this form would have superior OOD capabilities, in much the same way that classical algorithms work for all instances. We rigorously analyze the role of algorithmic alignment in achieving OOD generalization, focusing on graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to the canonical shortest path problem. We prove that GNNs, trained to minimize a sparsity-regularized loss over a small set of shortest path instances, exactly implement the Bellman-Ford (BF) algorithm for shortest paths. In fact, if a GNN minimizes this loss within an error of $\\epsilon$, it implements the BF algorithm with an error of $O(\\epsilon)$. Consequently, despite limited training data, these GNNs are guaranteed to extrapolate to arbitrary shortest-path problems, including instances of any size. Our empirical results support our theory by showing that NNs trained by gradient descent are able to minimize this loss and extrapolate in practice.",

      "abstract": "We consider a strategic network monitoring problem involving the operator of a networked system and an attacker. The operator aims to randomize the placement of multiple protected sensors to monitor and protect components that are vulnerable to attacks. We account for the heterogeneity in the components' security levels and formulate a large-scale maximin optimization problem. After analyzing its structure, we propose a three-step approach to approximately solve the problem. First, we solve a generalized covering set problem and run a combinatorial algorithm to compute an approximate solution. Then, we compute approximation bounds by solving a nonlinear set packing problem. To evaluate our solution approach, we implement two classical solution methods based on column generation and multiplicative weights updates, and test them on real-world water distribution and power systems. Our numerical analysis shows that our solution method outperforms the classical methods on large-scale networks, as it efficiently generates solutions that achieve a close to optimal performance and that are simple to implement in practice.",
