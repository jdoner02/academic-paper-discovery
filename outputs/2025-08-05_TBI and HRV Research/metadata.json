      "abstract": "The trajectory of an individual's recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is heterogeneous, with complete recovery in some cases but persistent disability in others. We hypothesized that changes in structural brain network abnormalities guide the trajectory of an individual's recovery post-injury. Our objective was to characterize the variability in recovery post-TBI by identifying a putative neuroimaging biomarker of traumatic axonal injury (TAI) in individuals with mild TBI.   We analyzed 70 T1-weighted and diffusion MRIs longitudinally collected from 35 individuals during the subacute and chronic post-injury periods. Each individual underwent longitudinal blood work to characterize blood protein biomarkers of axonal and glial injury and assessment of post-injury recovery in the subacute and chronic periods. By comparing the MRI data of individual cases with 35 controls, we estimated the longitudinal change in structural brain network abnormalities. We validated this proxy measure of TAI with independent measures of acute intracranial injury estimated from head CT and blood protein biomarkers.   Post-injury structural network abnormality was significantly higher than controls in both subacute and chronic periods, associated with an acute CT lesion and subacute blood levels of glial fibrillary acid protein (r=0.5, p=0.008) and neurofilament light (r=0.41, p=0.02). Longitudinal change in abnormality associated with change in functional outcome status (r=-0.51, p=0.003) and post-concussive symptoms (BSI: r=0.46, p=0.03; RPQ:r = 0.46, p=0.02). Brain regions that most closely mapped onto symptom change over time corresponded to structural network hubs or areas susceptible to neurotrauma.   Structural network abnormalities might be a biomarker of TAI. Assessing changes in brain network abnormality might enable better patient stratification for monitoring recovery after neurotrauma.",

      "abstract": "The prediction and prevention of traumatic brain injury is a very important aspect of preventive medical science. This paper proposes a new coupled loading-rate hypothesis for the traumatic brain injury (TBI), which states that the main cause of the TBI is an external Euclidean jolt, or SE(3)-jolt, an impulsive loading that strikes the head in several coupled degrees-of-freedom simultaneously. To show this, based on the previously defined covariant force law, we formulate the coupled Newton-Euler dynamics of brain's micro-motions within the cerebrospinal fluid and derive from it the coupled SE(3)-jolt dynamics. The SE(3)-jolt is a cause of the TBI in two forms of brain's rapid discontinuous deformations: translational dislocations and rotational disclinations. Brain's dislocations and disclinations, caused by the SE(3)-jolt, are described using the Cosserat multipolar viscoelastic continuum brain model.   Keywords: Traumatic brain injuries, coupled loading-rate hypothesis, Euclidean jolt, coupled Newton-Euler dynamics, brain's dislocations and disclinations",

The diagnosis of TBI relies on clinical information along with Computed Tomography (CT) scans. Addressing the multifaceted challenges posed by TBI has seen the development of innovative, data-driven approaches, for this complex condition. Particularly noteworthy is the prevalence of mild TBI (mTBI), which constitutes the majority of TBI cases where conventional methods often fall short. As such, we review the state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) techniques applied to clinical information and CT scans in TBI, with a particular focus on mTBI. We categorize ML applications based on their data sources, and there is a spectrum of ML techniques used to date. Most of these techniques have primarily focused on diagnosis, with relatively few attempts at predicting the prognosis. This review may serve as a source of inspiration for future research studies aimed at improving the diagnosis of TBI using data-driven approaches and standard diagnostic data.",

A comprehensive set of sensitive, robust and non-invasive measurements is therefore essential in assessing variations in speech characteristics over time following pediatric TBI. In this article, we study the changes in the acoustic speech patterns of a pediatric cohort of ten subjects diagnosed with severe TBI. We extract a diverse set of both well-known and novel acoustic features from child speech recorded throughout the year after the child produced intelligible words. These features are analyzed individually and by speech subsystem, within-subject and across the cohort. As a group, older children exhibit highly significant (p<0.01) increases in pitch variation and phoneme diversity, shortened pause length, and steadying articulation rate variability. Younger children exhibit similar steadied rate variability alongside an increase in formant-based articulation complexity. Correlation analysis of the feature set with age and comparisons to normative developmental data confirm that age at injury plays a significant role in framing the recovery trajectory. Nearly all speech features significantly change (p<0.05) for the cohort as a whole, confirming that acoustic measures supplementing perceptual assessment are needed to identify efficacious treatment targets for speech therapy following TBI.",

While many studies have delved into TBI phenotyping for distinct patient populations, identifying TBI phenotypes that consistently generalize across various settings and populations remains a critical research gap. Our research addresses this by employing multivariate time-series clustering to unveil TBI's dynamic intricates. Utilizing a self-supervised learning-based approach to clustering multivariate time-Series data with missing values (SLAC-Time), we analyzed both the research-centric TRACK-TBI and the real-world MIMIC-IV datasets. Remarkably, the optimal hyperparameters of SLAC-Time and the ideal number of clusters remained consistent across these datasets, underscoring SLAC-Time's stability across heterogeneous datasets. Our analysis revealed three generalizable TBI phenotypes ({\\alpha}, \\b{eta}, and {\\gamma}), each exhibiting distinct non-temporal features during emergency department visits, and temporal feature profiles throughout ICU stays. Specifically, phenotype {\\alpha} represents mild TBI with a remarkably consistent clinical presentation. In contrast, phenotype \\b{eta} signifies severe TBI with diverse clinical manifestations, and phenotype {\\gamma} represents a moderate TBI profile in terms of severity and clinical diversity. Age is a significant determinant of TBI outcomes, with older cohorts recording higher mortality rates. Importantly, while certain features varied by age, the core characteristics of TBI manifestations tied to each phenotype remain consistent across diverse populations.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBIs) resulting from Road Traffic Crashes (RTCs) can have fatal and disabling effects on patients. In this study, we evaluated the TBIs outcomes of patients involved in RTCs and identify key contributing factors affecting these outcomes. Data on 207 patients recorded by physicians at a tertiary hospital in Bangladesh was collected. A random parameters multinomial logit model with heterogeneity in the means was utilized to assess patients outcomes in three categories: Non-surgical, Surgical, and Fatal. From the random parameters, the study found that male patients (55.48%) are more likely to experience surgical and fatal outcomes. Male motorcycle users have a higher probability of experiencing fatal consequences. Additionally, 60.94% of incidents on rural roads result in surgeries and fatalities, with nighttime crashes on these roads significantly increasing the likelihood of fatal outcomes. Key factors impacting the likelihood of TBIs outcomes include older age, pedestrian involvement, bus and truck crashes, speeding, wet pavements, overtaking, low visibility, and weekday crashes. The study identified two significant interaction variables that increase the probability of fatal outcomes from TBIs: the interactions between low visibility and bus involvement, and between overtaking and wet pavements. While these factors individually had a higher probability of leading to both surgical and fatal outcomes, together these factors increase the risks to fatalities. Overall, our findings provide more detailed insights about the impact of TBIs outcomes resulting from RTCs and emphasize the need to develop more effective measures to improve road safety and patient outcomes.",

This study applies supervised machine learning (ML) methods to predict mortality and FSS scores using a real-world dataset of 300 pediatric TBI patients from the University of Colorado School of Medicine. The dataset captures clinical features, including demographics, injury mechanisms, and hospitalization outcomes. Eighteen ML models were evaluated for mortality prediction, and thirteen models were assessed for FSS score prediction. Performance was measured using accuracy, ROC AUC, F1-score, and mean squared error. Logistic regression and Extra Trees models achieved high precision in mortality prediction, while linear regression demonstrated the best FSS score prediction. Feature selection reduced 103 clinical variables to the most relevant, enhancing model efficiency and interpretability. This research highlights the role of ML models in identifying high-risk patients and supporting personalized interventions, demonstrating the potential of data-driven analytics to improve TBI care and integrate into clinical workflows.",

We investigated the pathophysiology evolution within the first three hours after closed-head traumatic brain injury (TBI) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), two common traumatic vascular injuries, in mice. We took a multi-modal imaging approach using photoacoustic, color Doppler, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in mice. Brain oxygenation (%sO2) and velocity-weighted volume of blood flow (VVF) values significantly decreased from baseline to fifteen minutes after both TBI and SAH. TBI resulted in 19.2% and 41.0% ipsilateral %sO2 and VVF reductions 15 minutes post injury while SAH resulted in 43.9% %sO2 and 85.0% VVF reduction ipsilaterally (p<0.001). We found partial recovery of %sO2 from 15 minutes to 3-hours after injury for TBI but not SAH. Hemorrhage, edema, reduced perfusion, and altered diffusivity were evident from MRI scans acquired 90-150 minutes after injury in both models although the spatial distribution was mostly focal for TBI and diffuse for SAH. The results reveal that the cerebral %sO2 deficits immediately following injuries are reversible for TBI and irreversible for SAH. Our findings can inform future studies on mitigating these early responses to improve long-term recovery.",

In this work, we develop a method for modeling large heterogeneous data types relevant to TBI. Our approach is geared toward the probabilistic representation of mixed continuous and discrete variables with missing values. The model is trained on a dataset encompassing a variety of data types, including demographics, blood-based biomarkers, and imaging findings. In addition, it includes a set of clinical outcome assessments at 3, 6, and 12 months post-injury. The model is used to stratify patients into distinct groups in an unsupervised learning setting. We use the model to infer outcomes using input data, and show that the collection of input data reduces uncertainty of outcomes over a baseline approach. In addition, we quantify the performance of a likelihood scoring technique that can be used to self-evaluate the extrapolation risk of prognosis on unseen patients.",

Patient characteristics such as age, motor and pupil responsiveness, hypoxia and hypotension, and radiological findings on computed tomography (CT), have been identified as important variables for TBI outcome prediction. CT is the acute imaging modality of choice in clinical practice because of its acquisition speed and widespread availability. However, this modality is mainly used for qualitative and semi-quantitative assessment, such as the Marshall scoring system, which is prone to subjectivity and human errors. This work explores the predictive power of imaging biomarkers extracted from routinely-acquired hospital admission CT scans using a state-of-the-art, deep learning TBI lesion segmentation method. We use lesion volumes and corresponding lesion statistics as inputs for an extended TBI outcome prediction model. We compare the predictive power of our proposed features to the Marshall score, independently and when paired with classic TBI biomarkers. We find that automatically extracted quantitative CT features perform similarly or better than the Marshall score in predicting unfavourable TBI outcomes. Leveraging automatic atlas alignment, we also identify frontal extra-axial lesions as important indicators of poor outcome. Our work may contribute to a better understanding of TBI, and provides new insights into how automated neuroimaging analysis can be used to improve prognostication after TBI.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the association between injury severity and patients' potential for recovery is crucial to providing better care for patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI). Estimation of this relationship requires clinical information on injury severity, patient demographics, and healthcare utilization, which are often obtained from separate data sources. Because of privacy and confidentiality regulations, these data sources do not include unique identifiers to link records across data sources. Record linkage is a process to identify records that represent the same entity across data sources in the absence of unique identifiers. These processes commonly rely on agreement between variables that appear in both data sources to link records. However, when the number of records in each file is large, this task is computationally intensive and may result in false links. Blocking is a data partitioning technique that reduces the number of possible links that should be considered. Healthcare providers can be used as blocks in applications of record linkage with healthcare datasets. However, providers may not be uniquely identified across files. We propose a Bayesian record linkage procedure that simultaneously performs block-level and record-level linkage. This iterative approach incorporates the record-level linkage within block pairs to improve the accuracy of the block-level linkage. Subsequently, the algorithm improves record-level linkage using the accurate partitioning of the linkage space through blocking. We demonstrate that our proposed method provides improved performance compared to existing Bayesian record linkage methods that do not incorporate blocking. The proposed procedure is then used to merge registry data from the National Trauma Data Bank with Medicare claims data to estimate the relationship between injury severity and TBI patients' recovery.",

      "abstract": "When a patient is admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) after a traumatic brain injury (TBI), an early prognosis is essential for baseline risk adjustment and shared decision making. TBI outcomes are commonly categorised by the Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) into 8, ordered levels of functional recovery at 6 months after injury. Existing ICU prognostic models predict binary outcomes at a certain threshold of GOSE (e.g., prediction of survival [GOSE>1] or functional independence [GOSE>4]). We aimed to develop ordinal prediction models that concurrently predict probabilities of each GOSE score. From a prospective cohort (n=1,550, 65 centres) in the ICU stratum of the Collaborative European NeuroTrauma Effectiveness Research in TBI (CENTER-TBI) patient dataset, we extracted all clinical information within 24 hours of ICU admission (1,151 predictors) and 6-month GOSE scores. We analysed the effect of 2 design elements on ordinal model performance: (1) the baseline predictor set, ranging from a concise set of 10 validated predictors to a token-embedded representation of all possible predictors, and (2) the modelling strategy, from ordinal logistic regression to multinomial deep learning. With repeated k-fold cross-validation, we found that expanding the baseline predictor set significantly improved ordinal prediction performance while increasing analytical complexity did not. Half of these gains could be achieved with the addition of 8 high-impact predictors (2 demographic variables, 4 protein biomarkers, and 2 severity assessments) to the concise set. At best, ordinal models achieved 0.76 (95% CI: 0.74-0.77) ordinal discrimination ability (ordinal c-index) and 57% (95% CI: 54%-60%) explanation of ordinal variation in 6-month GOSE (Somers' D). Our results motivate the search for informative predictors for higher GOSE and the development of ordinal dynamic prediction models.",

      "abstract": "Identifying patients at risk of traumatic brain injury (TBI) is important because research suggests prophylactic treatments to reduce risk of long-term sequelae. Blast pressure waves can cause TBI without penetrating wounds or blunt force trauma. Similarly, bullet impacts distant from the brain can produce pressure waves sufficient to cause mild to moderate TBI. The fluid percussion model of TBI shows that pressure impulses of 15-30 psi cause mild to moderate TBI in laboratory animals. In pigs and dogs, bullet impacts to the thigh produce pressure waves in the brain of 18-45 psi and measurable injury to neurons and neuroglia. Analyses of research in goats and epidemiological data from shooting events involving humans show high correlations (r > 0.9) between rapid incapacitation and pressure wave magnitude in the thoracic cavity. A case study has documented epilepsy resulting from a pressure wave without the bullet directly hitting the brain. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that bullet impacts distant from the brain produce pressure waves that travel to the brain and can retain sufficient magnitude to induce brain injury. The link to long-term sequelae could be investigated via epidemiological studies of patients who were gunshot in the chest to determine whether they experience elevated rates of epilepsy and other neurological sequelae.",

Biomarkers that map onto the underlying brain pathology driving these complications are urgently needed to identify individuals at risk for poor recovery and to inform design of clinical trials of neuroprotective therapies. Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are two endophenotypes associated with increases in brain extracellular water content after trauma. The objective of this study was to describe the relationship between a neuroimaging biomarker of extracellular free water content and the clinical features of patients with traumatic brain injury. We analyzed a cohort of 64 adult patients requiring hospitalization for non-penetrating traumatic brain injury of all severities as well as 32 healthy controls. Patients underwent brain MRI and clinical neuropsychological assessment in the subacute (2-weeks) and chronic (6-months) post-injury period, and controls underwent a single MRI. For each subject, we derived a summary score representing deviations in whole brain white matter (1) extracellular free water volume fraction (VF) and (2) free water-corrected fractional anisotropy (fw-FA). The summary specific anomaly score (SAS) for VF was significantly higher in TBI patients in the subacute and chronic post-injury period relative to controls. SAS for VF significantly correlated with neuropsychological functioning in the subacute, but not chronic post-injury period. These findings indicate abnormalities in whole brain white matter extracellular water fraction in patients with TBI and are an important step toward identifying and validating noninvasive biomarkers that map onto the pathology driving disability after TBI.",

The findings revealed significant gaps between the current capabilities of CAs and accessibility challenges faced by TBI users.

The random forest classifier achieved the highest performance with an 85% accuracy and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.94. Factors found to be predictive of PCS outcome were Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), perceived injustice, self-rated prognosis, and symptom severity post-injury.

Furthermore, the assertion that the horns provide necessary cushioning of the blow is inconsistent with the absence of concussions in domestic breeds of hornless sheep. Results from traumatic brain injury (TBI) research allow acceleration tolerance of sheep to be estimated as 450 g facilitating an analysis of sheep collisions that is more consistent with available observations (stopping distance less than 1 cm, impact time of roughly 2 ms).",

Both manifestations exhibit the extensive presence of focal axonal swellings (FAS). FAS compromises the information encoded in spike trains, thus leading to potentially severe functional deficits. Complicating our understanding of the impact of FAS is our inability to access small scale injuries with non-invasive methods, the overall complexity of neuronal pathologies, and our limited knowledge of how networks process biological signals. Building on Hopfield's pioneering work, we extend a model for associative memory to account for FAS and its impact on memory encoding. We calibrate all FAS parameters from biophysical observations of their statistical distribution and size, providing a framework to simulate the effects of brain disorders on memory recall performance. A face recognition example is used to demonstrate and validate the functionality of the novel model. Our results link memory recall ability to observed FAS statistics, allowing for a description of different stages of brain disorders within neuronal networks. This provides a first theoretical model to bridge experimental observations of FAS in neurodegeneration and TBI with compromised memory recall, thus closing the large gap between theory and experiment on how biological signals are processed in damaged, high-dimensional functional networks. The work further lends new insight into positing diagnostic tools to measure cognitive deficits.",

Recently, there has been a push towards using computationally expensive finite element (FE) models of the brain to create tissue deformation metrics of brain injury. Here, we developed a 3 degree-of-freedom lumped-parameter brain model, built based on the measured natural frequencies of a FE brain model simulated with live human impact data, to be used to rapidly estimate peak brain strains experienced during head rotational accelerations. On our dataset, the simplified model correlates with peak principal FE strain by an R2 of 0.80. Further, coronal and axial model displacement correlated with fiber-oriented peak strain in the corpus callosum with an R2 of 0.77. Using the maximum displacement predicted by our brain model, we propose an injury criteria and compare it against a number of existing rotational and translational kinematic injury metrics on a dataset of head kinematics from 27 clinically diagnosed injuries and 887 non-injuries. We found that our proposed metric performed comparably to peak angular acceleration, linear acceleration, and angular velocity in classifying injury and non-injury events. Metrics which separated time traces into their directional components had improved deviance to those which combined components into a single time trace magnitude. Our brain model can be used in future work as a computationally efficient alternative to FE models for classifying injuries over a wide range of loading conditions.",

      "abstract": "Over the past decade, the intricacies of sports-related concussions among female athletes have become readily apparent. Traditional clinical methods for diagnosing concussions suffer limitations when applied to female athletes, often failing to capture subtle changes in brain structure and function. Advanced neuroinformatics techniques and machine learning models have become invaluable assets in this endeavor. While these technologies have been extensively employed in understanding concussion in male athletes, there remains a significant gap in our comprehension of their effectiveness for female athletes. With its remarkable data analysis capacity, machine learning offers a promising avenue to bridge this deficit. By harnessing the power of machine learning, researchers can link observed phenotypic neuroimaging data to sex-specific biological mechanisms, unraveling the mysteries of concussions in female athletes. Furthermore, embedding methods within machine learning enable examining brain architecture and its alterations beyond the conventional anatomical reference frame. In turn, allows researchers to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of concussions, treatment responses, and recovery processes. To guarantee that female athletes receive the optimal care they deserve, researchers must employ advanced neuroimaging techniques and sophisticated machine-learning models. These tools enable an in-depth investigation of the underlying mechanisms responsible for concussion symptoms stemming from neuronal dysfunction in female athletes. This paper endeavors to address the crucial issue of sex differences in multimodal neuroimaging experimental design and machine learning approaches within female athlete populations, ultimately ensuring that they receive the tailored care they require when facing the challenges of concussions.",

      "abstract": "Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) detection presents significant challenges due to the subtle and often ambiguous presentation of symptoms in medical imaging, making accurate diagnosis a complex task. To address these challenges, we propose Proof-of-TBI, a medical diagnosis support system that integrates multiple fine-tuned vision-language models with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning large language model (LLM). Our approach fine-tunes multiple vision-language models using a labeled dataset of TBI MRI scans, training them to diagnose TBI symptoms effectively. The predictions from these models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making process. The system evaluates the predictions from all fine-tuned vision language models using the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, a model that has demonstrated remarkable reasoning performance, to produce the most accurate final diagnosis. The LLM Agents orchestrates interactions between the vision-language models and the reasoning LLM, managing the final decision-making process with transparency, reliability, and automation. This end-to-end decision-making workflow combines the vision-language model consortium with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM, enabled by custom prompt engineering by the LLM agents. The prototype for the proposed platform was developed in collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research team in Newport News, Virginia, incorporating five fine-tuned vision-language models. The results demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned vision-language model inputs with the OpenAI-o3 reasoning LLM to create a robust, secure, and highly accurate diagnostic system for mild TBI prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this research represents the first application of fine-tuned vision-language models integrated with a reasoning LLM for TBI prediction tasks.",

However, it is difficult to construct a TBI segmentation model as manually annotated MR scans of TBI patients are hard to collect. Data augmentation techniques can be applied to alleviate the issue of data scarcity. However, conventional data augmentation strategies such as spatial and intensity transformation are unable to mimic the deformation and lesions in traumatic brains, which limits the performance of the subsequent segmentation task. To address these issues, we propose a novel medical image inpainting model named TBI-GAN to synthesize TBI MR scans with paired brain label maps. The main strength of our TBI-GAN method is that it can generate TBI images and corresponding label maps simultaneously, which has not been achieved in the previous inpainting methods for medical images. We first generate the inpainted image under the guidance of edge information following a coarse-to-fine manner, and then the synthesized intensity image is used as the prior for label inpainting. Furthermore, we introduce a registration-based template augmentation pipeline to increase the diversity of the synthesized image pairs and enhance the capacity of data augmentation. Experimental results show that the proposed TBI-GAN method can produce sufficient synthesized TBI images with high quality and valid label maps, which can greatly improve the 2D and 3D traumatic brain segmentation performance compared with the alternatives.",

However, the overfitting to simulated impacts and the lack of generalizability caused by distributional shift of different head impact datasets hinders the broad clinical applications of current MLHMs. We propose brain deformation estimators that integrates unsupervised domain adaptation with a deep neural network to predict whole-brain maximum principal strain (MPS) and MPS rate (MPSR). With 12,780 simulated head impacts, we performed unsupervised domain adaptation on on-field head impacts from 302 college football (CF) impacts and 457 mixed martial arts (MMA) impacts using domain regularized component analysis (DRCA) and cycle-GAN-based methods. The new model improved the MPS/MPSR estimation accuracy, with the DRCA method significantly outperforming other domain adaptation methods in prediction accuracy (p<0.001): MPS RMSE: 0.027 (CF) and 0.037 (MMA); MPSR RMSE: 7.159 (CF) and 13.022 (MMA). On another two hold-out test sets with 195 college football impacts and 260 boxing impacts, the DRCA model significantly outperformed the baseline model without domain adaptation in MPS and MPSR estimation accuracy (p<0.001). The DRCA domain adaptation reduces the MPS/MPSR estimation error to be well below TBI thresholds, enabling accurate brain deformation estimation to detect TBI in future clinical applications.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a common cause of death and disability. However, existing tools for TBI diagnosis are either subjective or require extensive clinical setup and expertise. The increasing affordability and reduction in size of relatively high-performance computing systems combined with promising results from TBI related machine learning research make it possible to create compact and portable systems for early detection of TBI. This work describes a Raspberry Pi based portable, real-time data acquisition, and automated processing system that uses machine learning to efficiently identify TBI and automatically score sleep stages from a single-channel Electroen-cephalogram (EEG) signal. We discuss the design, implementation, and verification of the system that can digitize EEG signal using an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC) and perform real-time signal classification to detect the presence of mild TBI (mTBI). We utilize Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost based predictive models to evaluate the performance and demonstrate the versatility of the system to operate with multiple types of predictive models. We achieve a peak classification accuracy of more than 90% with a classification time of less than 1 s across 16 s - 64 s epochs for TBI vs control conditions. This work can enable development of systems suitable for field use without requiring specialized medical equipment for early TBI detection applications and TBI research. Further, this work opens avenues to implement connected, real-time TBI related health and wellness monitoring systems.",

State-of-the-art efforts continue to rely on empirical, scalar metrics based on kinematics or model-estimated tissue responses explicitly pre-defined in a specific brain region of interest.

In this study, we developed a deep learning approach for concussion classification using implicit features of the entire voxel-wise white matter fiber strains. Using reconstructed American National Football League (NFL) injury cases, leave-one-out cross-validation was employed to objectively compare injury prediction performances against two baseline machine learning classifiers (support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF)) and four scalar metrics via univariate logistic regression (Brain Injury Criterion (BrIC), cumulative strain damage measure of the whole brain (CSDM-WB) and the corpus callosum (CSDM-CC), and peak fiber strain in the CC). Feature-based deep learning and machine learning classifiers consistently outperformed all scalar injury metrics across all performance categories in cross-validation (e.g., average accuracy of 0.844 vs. 0.746, and average area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.873 vs. 0.769, respectively, based on the testing dataset). Nevertheless, deep learning achieved the best cross-validation accuracy, sensitivity, and AUC (e.g., accuracy of 0.862 vs. 0.828 and 0.842 for SVM and RF, respectively). These findings demonstrate the superior performances of deep learning in concussion prediction, and suggest its promise for future applications in biomechanical investigations of traumatic brain injury.",

We simulate the effects of neurodegenerative disease and TBI using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as our model of cognition. We utilize biophysically relevant statistical data on FAS to damage the connections in CNNs in a functionally relevant way. We incorporate energy constraints on the brain by pruning the CNNs to be less over-engineered. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that damage leads to human-like mistakes. Our experiments also provide quantitative assessments of how accuracy is affected by various types and levels of damage. The deficit resulting from a fixed amount of damage greatly depends on which connections are randomly injured, providing intuition for why it is difficult to predict impairments. There is a large degree of subjectivity when it comes to interpreting cognitive deficits from complex systems such as the human brain.

The maximum principal strain (MPS) was used to measure the extent of brain deformation and predict injury, and the recent evidence has indicated that incorporating the maximum principal strain rate (MPSR) and the product of MPS and MPSR, denoted as MPSxSR, enhances the accuracy of TBI prediction. However, ambiguities have arisen about the calculation of MPSR. Two schemes have been utilized: one (MPSR1) is to use the time derivative of MPS, and another (MPSR2) is to use the first eigenvalue of the strain rate tensor. Both MPSR1 and MPSR2 have been applied in previous studies to predict TBI. To quantify the discrepancies between these two methodologies, we conducted a comparison of these two MPSR methodologies across nine in-vivo and in-silico head impact datasets and found that 95MPSR1 was 5.87% larger than 95MPSR2, and 95MPSxSR1 was 2.55% larger than 95MPSxSR2. Across every element in all head impacts, MPSR1 was 8.28% smaller than MPSR2, and MPSxSR1 was 8.11% smaller than MPSxSR2. Furthermore, logistic regression models were trained to predict TBI based on the MPSR (or MPSxSR), and no significant difference was observed in the predictability across different variables. The consequence of misuse of MPSR and MPSxSR thresholds (i.e. compare threshold of 95MPSR1 with value from 95MPSR2 to determine if the impact is injurious) was investigated, and the resulting false rates were found to be around 1%. The evidence suggested that these two methodologies were not significantly different in detecting TBI.",

On a prospective cohort (n=1,550, 65 centres) of TBI patients, we train recurrent neural network models to map a token-embedded time series representation of all variables (including missing values) to an ordinal GOSE prognosis every two hours. The full range of variables explains up to 52% (95% CI: 50%-54%) of the ordinal variance in functional outcome. Up to 91% (95% CI: 90%-91%) of this explanation is derived from pre-ICU and admission information (i.e., static variables). Information collected in the ICU (i.e., dynamic variables) increases explanation (by up to 5% [95% CI: 4%-6%]), though not enough to counter poorer overall performance in longer-stay (>5.75 days) patients. Highest-contributing variables include physician-based prognoses, CT features, and markers of neurological function. Whilst static information currently accounts for the majority of functional outcome explanation after TBI, data-driven analysis highlights investigative avenues to improve dynamic characterisation of longer-stay patients.

Timely detection and prognostication of VAP in TBI patients are crucial to improve patient outcomes and alleviate the strain on healthcare resources.   Methods: We implemented six machine learning models using the MIMIC-III database. Our methodology included preprocessing steps, such as feature selection with CatBoost and expert opinion, addressing class imbalance with the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), and rigorous model tuning through 5-fold cross-validation to optimize hyperparameters. Key models evaluated included SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, ANN, and AdaBoost. Additionally, we conducted SHAP analysis to determine feature importance and performed an ablation study to assess feature impacts on model performance.   Results: XGBoost outperformed the baseline models and the best existing literature. We used metrics, including AUC, Accuracy, Specificity, Sensitivity, F1 Score, PPV, and NPV. XGBoost demonstrated the highest performance with an AUC of 0.940 and an Accuracy of 0.875, which are 23.4% and 23.5% higher than the best results in the existing literature, with an AUC of 0.706 and an Accuracy of 0.640, respectively. This enhanced performance underscores the models' effectiveness in clinical settings.   Conclusions: This study enhances the predictive modeling of VAP in TBI patients, improving early detection and intervention potential. Refined feature selection and advanced ensemble techniques significantly boosted model accuracy and reliability, offering promising directions for future clinical applications and medical diagnostics research.",

With the advancement of technology, virtual reality (VR) can be utilized to advance the standardization of the VOMS, increasing the accuracy of testing administration and decreasing overall false positive rates. In this paper, we experimented with multiple machine learning methods to detect SRC on VR-generated data using VOMS. In our observation, the data generated from VR for smooth pursuit (SP) and the Visual Motion Sensitivity (VMS) tests are highly reliable for concussion detection. Furthermore, we train and evaluate these models, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our findings show these models can reach high true-positive-rates of around 99.9 percent of symptom provocation on the VR stimuli-based VOMS vs. current clinical manual VOMS.",

Because traumatic brain injury (TBI) due to blast exposure has become a prominent medical and military problem, similar thresholds should be identified that can put available research results in context and guide future research toward protecting warfighters as well as diagnosis and treatment. At least three mechanical mechanisms by which the blast wave may result in brain injury have been proposed - a thoracic mechanism, head acceleration and direct cranial transmission. These mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive. In this study, likely regions of interest for the first two mechanisms based on blast characteristics (positive pulse duration and peak effective overpressure) are developed using available data from blast experiments and related studies, including behind-armor blunt trauma and ballistic pressure wave studies. These related studies are appropriate to include because blast-like pressure waves are produced that result in neurological effects like those caused by blast. Results suggest that injury thresholds for each mechanism are dependent on blast conditions, and that under some conditions, more than one mechanism may contribute. There is a subset of blast conditions likely to result in TBI due to head acceleration and/or a thoracic mechanism without concomitant lung injury. These results can be used to guide experimental designs and compare additional data as they become available. Additional data are needed before actual probabilities or severity of TBI for a given exposure can be described.",

In such instances, machine learning models that exhibit exceptional performance on a specific dataset may not necessarily demonstrate similar proficiency when applied to a distinct dataset for the same task. The scarcity of high-quality biomedical data further compounds this challenge, making it difficult to evaluate the model's generality comprehensively. In this paper, we introduce Transfer Euclidean Alignment - a transfer learning technique to tackle the problem of the dearth of human biomedical data for training deep learning models. We tested the robustness of this transfer learning technique on various rule-based classical machine learning models as well as the EEGNet-based deep learning model by evaluating on different datasets, including human and mouse data in a binary classification task of detecting individuals with versus without traumatic brain injury (TBI). By demonstrating notable improvements with an average increase of 14.42% for intraspecies datasets and 5.53% for interspecies datasets, our findings underscore the importance of the use of transfer learning to improve the performance of machine learning and deep learning models when using diverse datasets for training.",

However, the traditional approach for lesion classification is restricted to visual image inspection. In this work, we characterize and predict TBI lesions by using CT-derived radiomics descriptors. Relevant shape, intensity and texture biomarkers characterizing the different lesions are isolated and a lesion predictive model is built by using Partial Least Squares. On a dataset containing 155 scans (105 train, 50 test) the methodology achieved 89.7 % accuracy over the unseen data. When a model was build using only texture features, a 88.2 % accuracy was obtained. Our results suggest that selected radiomics descriptors could play a key role in brain injury prediction. Besides, the proposed methodology is close to reproduce radiologists decision making. These results open new possibilities for radiomics-inspired brain lesion detection, segmentation and prediction.",

      "abstract": "The segmentation of lesions in Moderate to Severe Traumatic Brain Injury (msTBI) presents a significant challenge in neuroimaging due to the diverse characteristics of these lesions, which vary in size, shape, and distribution across brain regions and tissue types. This heterogeneity complicates traditional image processing techniques, resulting in critical errors in tasks such as image registration and brain parcellation. To address these challenges, the AIMS-TBI Segmentation Challenge 2024 aims to advance innovative segmentation algorithms specifically designed for T1-weighted MRI data, the most widely utilized imaging modality in clinical practice. Our proposed solution leverages a large-scale multi-dataset supervised pretraining approach inspired by the MultiTalent method. We train a Resenc L network on a comprehensive collection of datasets covering various anatomical and pathological structures, which equips the model with a robust understanding of brain anatomy and pathology. Following this, the model is fine-tuned on msTBI-specific data to optimize its performance for the unique characteristics of T1-weighted MRI scans and outperforms the baseline without pretraining up to 2 Dice points.",

      "abstract": "The sport-related concussion (SRC) battery relies heavily upon subjective symptom reporting in order to determine the diagnosis of a concussion. Unfortunately, athletes with SRC may return-to-play (RTP) too soon if they are untruthful of their symptoms. It is critical to provide accurate assessments that can overcome underreporting to prevent further injury. To lower the risk of injury, a more robust and precise method for detecting concussion is needed to produce reliable and objective results. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to detect SRC using long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures from oculomotor data. In particular, we propose a new error metric that incorporates mean squared error in different proportions. The experimental results on the smooth pursuit test of the VR-VOMS dataset suggest that the proposed approach can predict concussion symptoms with higher accuracy compared to symptom provocation on the vestibular ocular motor screening (VOMS).",

      "abstract": "The discovery that repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) can result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in high risk contact sports has led to increased scrutiny of head protective gear. In this work, we asked if it was physically possible to prevent mTBI in American football with helmets alone. Here, we show that modern helmets of several types are unlikely to prevent mTBI from high speed collisions as might be seen in the NFL, but that introducing liquid as an energy absorbing medium can dramatically reduce the forces of impact across a spectrum of impact severities. We hypothesized that a helmet which transmits a nearly constant force during football impacts is sufficient to reduce biomechanical loading in the brain below the threshold of mTBI. To test this hypothesis, we first show that the optimal impact force transmitted to the head, in terms of brain strain, is in fact a constant force profile. Then, to generate a constant force with a helmet, we implement a computational model of a fluid-based shock absorber that adapts passively to any given impact speed. Computer simulation of head impacts with liquid shock absorption indicate that, at the highest impact speed, the average brain tissue strain is reduced by 27.6% $\\pm$ 9.3 compared to existing helmet padding that is available on the market. These simulations are based on the NFL's helmet test protocol and predict that adding liquid shock absorbers could reduce the number of concussions by at least 75%. Taken together, these results suggest that the majority of mTBI in football could be prevented with more efficient helmet technology.",

      "abstract": "Self-supervised learning approaches provide a promising direction for clustering multivariate time-series data. However, real-world time-series data often include missing values, and the existing approaches require imputing missing values before clustering, which may cause extensive computations and noise and result in invalid interpretations. To address these challenges, we present a Self-supervised Learning-based Approach to Clustering multivariate Time-series data with missing values (SLAC-Time). SLAC-Time is a Transformer-based clustering method that uses time-series forecasting as a proxy task for leveraging unlabeled data and learning more robust time-series representations. This method jointly learns the neural network parameters and the cluster assignments of the learned representations. It iteratively clusters the learned representations with the K-means method and then utilizes the subsequent cluster assignments as pseudo-labels to update the model parameters. To evaluate our proposed approach, we applied it to clustering and phenotyping Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) patients in the Transforming Research and Clinical Knowledge in Traumatic Brain Injury (TRACK-TBI) study. Our experiments demonstrate that SLAC-Time outperforms the baseline K-means clustering algorithm in terms of silhouette coefficient, Calinski Harabasz index, Dunn index, and Davies Bouldin index. We identified three TBI phenotypes that are distinct from one another in terms of clinically significant variables as well as clinical outcomes, including the Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOSE) score, Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay, and mortality rate. The experiments show that the TBI phenotypes identified by SLAC-Time can be potentially used for developing targeted clinical trials and therapeutic strategies.",

An accurate quantification of the lesion volumes and their locations is essential to understand the pathophysiology of TBI and its progression. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional neural network (CNN) model to segment contusions and lesions from brain magnetic resonance (MR) images of patients with TBI. The CNN architecture proposed here was based on a state of the art CNN architecture from Google, called Inception. Using a 3-layer Inception network, lesions are segmented from multi-contrast MR images. When compared with two recent TBI lesion segmentation methods, one based on CNN (called DeepMedic) and another based on random forests, the proposed algorithm showed improved segmentation accuracy on images of 18 patients with mild to severe TBI. Using a leave-one-out cross validation, the proposed model achieved a median Dice of 0.75, which was significantly better (p<0.01) than the two competing methods.",

      "abstract": "Rotational head motions have been shown to play a key role in traumatic brain injury. There is great interest in developing methods to rapidly predict brain tissue strains and strain rates resulting from rotational head motions to estimate brain injury risk and to guide the design of protective equipment. Idealized continuum mechanics based head models provide an attractive approach for rapidly estimating brain strains and strain rates. These models are capable of capturing the wave dynamics and transient response of the brain while being significantly easier and faster to apply compared to more sophisticated and detailed finite element head models. In this work, we present a new idealized continuum mechanics based head model that accounts for the head's finite rotation, which is an improvement upon prior models that have been based on a small rotation assumption. Despite the simplicity of the model, we show that the proposed 2D elastic finite rotation head model predicts comparable strains to a more detailed finite element head model, demonstrating the potential usefulness of the model in rapidly estimating brain injury risk. This newly proposed model can serve as a basis for introducing finite rotations into more sophisticated head models in the future.",
