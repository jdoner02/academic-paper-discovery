      "abstract": "To react to unforeseen circumstances or amend abnormal situations in communication-centric systems, programmers are in charge of \"undoing\" the interactions which led to an undesired state. To assist this task, session-based languages can be endowed with reversibility mechanisms. In this paper we propose a language enriched with programming facilities to commit session interactions, to roll back the computation to a previous commit point, and to abort the session. Rollbacks in our language always bring the system to previous visited states and a rollback cannot bring the system back to a point prior to the last commit. Programmers are relieved from the burden of ensuring that a rollback never restores a checkpoint imposed by a session participant different from the rollback requester. Such undesired situations are prevented at design-time (statically) by relying on a decidable compliance check at the type level, implemented in MAUDE. We show that the language satisfies error-freedom and progress of a session.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are subject to environmental uncertainties such as adverse operating conditions, malicious attacks, and hardware degradation. These uncertainties may lead to failures that put the system in a sub-optimal or unsafe state. Systems that are resilient to such uncertainties rely on two types of operations: (1) graceful degradation, to ensure that the system maintains an acceptable level of safety during unexpected environmental conditions and (2) recovery, to facilitate the resumption of normal system functions. Typically, mechanisms for degradation and recovery are developed independently from each other, and later integrated into a system, requiring the designer to develop an additional, ad-hoc logic for activating and coordinating between the two operations. In this paper, we propose a self-adaptation approach for improving system resiliency through automated triggering and coordination of graceful degradation and recovery. The key idea behind our approach is to treat degradation and recovery as requirement-driven adaptation tasks: Degradation can be thought of as temporarily weakening original (i.e., ideal) system requirements to be achieved by the system, and recovery as strengthening the weakened requirements when the environment returns within an expected operating boundary. Furthermore, by treating weakening and strengthening as dual operations, we argue that a single requirement-based adaptation method is sufficient to enable coordination between degradation and recovery. Given system requirements specified in signal temporal logic (STL), we propose a run-time adaptation framework that performs degradation and recovery in response to environmental changes. We describe a prototype implementation of our framework and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach using a case study in unmanned underwater vehicles.",

      "abstract": "Self-Healing Cyber-Physical Systems (SH-CPS) effectively recover from system perceived failures without human intervention. They ensure a level of resilience and tolerance to unforeseen situations that arise from intrinsic system and component degradation, errors, or malicious attacks. Implicit redundancy can be exploited in SH-CPS to structurally adapt without the need to explicitly duplicate components. However, implicitly redundant components do not guarantee the same level of dependability as the primary component used to provide for a given function. Additional processes are needed to restore critical system functionalities as desired. This work introduces implicit guarantees to ensure the dependability of implicitly redundant components and processes. Implicit guarantees can be obtained through inheritance and decomposition. Therefore, a level of dependability can be guaranteed in SH-CPS after adaptation and recovery while complying with requirements. We demonstrate compliance with the requirement guarantees while ensuring resilience in SH-CPS.",

      "abstract": "This paper tackles the problem of making complex resource-constrained cyber-physical systems (CPS) resilient to sensor anomalies. In particular, we present a framework for checkpointing and roll-forward recovery of state-estimates in nonlinear, hierarchical CPS with anomalous sensor data. We introduce three checkpointing paradigms for ensuring different levels of checkpointing consistency across the hierarchy. Our framework has algorithms implementing the consistent paradigm to perform accurate recovery in a time-efficient manner while managing the tradeoff with system resources and handling the interplay between diverse anomaly detection systems across the hierarchy. Further in this work, we detail bounds on the recovered state-estimate error, maximum tolerable anomaly duration and the accuracy-resource gap that results from the aforementioned tradeoff. We explore use-cases for our framework and evaluate it on a case study of a simulated ground robot to show that it scales to multiple hierarchies and performs better than an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that does not incorporate a checkpointing procedure during sensor anomalies. We conclude the work with a discussion on extending the proposed framework to distributed systems.",

      "abstract": "Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned as a transformative method for enhancing the physical layer security of future communication networks. However, current IRS-assisted secure wireless system designs incur high time cost for the joint optimization of beamforming vectors and IRS phase shifts and are susceptible to unforeseen disruption. Therefore, introducing resilience in IRS-assisted secure systems is essential. In this paper, we first quantify the resilience performance as the combination of the absorption and adaptation performance. In particular, the absorption performance measures the system's robustness when facing failure while the adaptation performance reflects the system's ability to recover from failure. Then, we propose a two-timescale transmission protocol aiming to enhance system resilience while limiting maximum information leakage to eavesdroppers. Specifically, in the initialization phase, the base station (BS) beamforming vectors and IRS phase shifts are optimized iteratively using an alternating optimization (AO) approach to improve the absorption performance of the system, i.e., the worst-case achievable rate, given a predefined maximum tolerable leakage rate, by accounting for the impact of long-term channel variations. When the system detects an outage, a fast system recovery mechanism is activated to restore operation by adjusting only the BS beamforming vectors, which enhances the adaptation performance of the system. Our numerical results reveal that the proposed algorithm significantly improves system resilience, including system robustness and recovery performance. Moreover, the proposed design guarantees outage-free transmission over a long time interval for moderate-size IRSs.",
