      "abstract": "In the developing topic of smart cities, Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) are crucial for providing successful interaction between vehicles and infrastructure. This research proposes a distributed Blockchain-based Vehicular Ad-hoc Network (DistB-VNET) architecture that includes binary malicious traffic classification, Software Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) to ensure safe, scalable, and reliable vehicular networks in smart cities. The suggested framework is the decentralized blockchain for safe data management and SDN-NFV for dynamic network management and resource efficiency and a noble isolation forest algorithm works as an IDS (Intrusion Detection System). Further, \"DistB-VNET\" offers a dual-layer blockchain system, where a distributed blockchain provides safe communication between vehicles, while a centralized blockchain in the cloud is in charge of data verification and storage. This improves security, scalability, and adaptability, ensuring better traffic management, data security, and privacy in VANETs. Furthermore, the unsupervised isolation forest model achieves a high accuracy of 99.23% for detecting malicious traffic. Additionally, reveals that our method greatly improves network performance, offering decreased latency, increased security, and reduced congestion, an effective alternative for existing smart city infrastructures.",

Control plane). When it comes to security, the centralization that this demands is ripe for a variety of cyber threats that are not typically seen in other network architectures. The authors in this research developed a novel machine-learning method to capture infections in networks. We applied the classifier to the UNSW-NB 15 intrusion detection benchmark and trained a model with this data. Random Forest and Decision Tree are classifiers used to assess with Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost. Out of these best-performing models was Gradient Boosting with an accuracy, recall, and F1 score of 99.87%,100%, and 99.85%, respectively, which makes it reliable in the detection of intrusions for SDN networks. The second best-performing classifier was also a Random Forest with 99.38% of accuracy, followed by Ada Boost and Decision Tree. The research shows that the reason that Gradient Boosting is so effective in this task is that it combines weak learners and creates a strong ensemble model that can predict if traffic belongs to a normal or malicious one with high accuracy. This paper indicates that the GBDT-IDS model is able to improve network security significantly and has better features in terms of both real-time detection accuracy and low false positive rates. In future work, we will integrate this model into live SDN space to observe its application and scalability. This research serves as an initial base on which one can make further strides forward to enhance security in SDN using ML techniques and have more secure, resilient networks.",

SDN facilitates network administration through a centralized view of the underlying physical topology; tampering with this topology view can result in catastrophic damage to network management and security. To underscore this issue, we introduce Marionette, a new topology poisoning technique that manipulates OpenFlow link discovery packet forwarding to alter topology information. Our approach exposes an overlooked yet widespread attack vector, distinguishing itself from traditional link fabrication attacks that tamper, spoof, or relay discovery packets at the data plane. Unlike localized attacks observed in existing methods, our technique introduces a globalized topology poisoning attack that leverages control privileges. Marionette implements a reinforcement learning algorithm to compute a poisoned topology target, and injects flow entries to achieve a long-lived stealthy attack. Our evaluation shows that Marionette successfully attacks five open-source controllers and nine OpenFlow-based discovery protocols. Marionette overcomes the state-of-the-art topology poisoning defenses, showcasing a new class of topology poisoning that initiates on the control plane.

Results: The SMS result comprises 33 primary studies analyzed against four major research questions. The SMS highlights current research trends and identifies gaps in the SDN-IoT network security.

      "abstract": "The CMSWEB cluster is pivotal to the activities of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, as it hosts critical services required for the operational needs of the CMS experiment. The security of these services and the corresponding data is crucial to CMS. Any malicious attack can compromise the availability of our services. Therefore, it is important to construct a robust security infrastructure. In this work, we discuss new security features introduced to the CMSWEB Kubernetes (\"k8s\") cluster. The new features include the implementation of network policies, deployment of Open Policy Agent (OPA), enforcement of OPA policies, and the integration of Vault. The network policies act as an inside-the-cluster firewall to limit the network communication between the pods to the minimum necessary, and its dynamic nature allows us to work with microservices. The OPA validates the objects against some custom-defined policies during create, update, and delete operations to further enhance security. Without recompiling or changing the configuration of the Kubernetes API server, it can apply customized policies on Kubernetes objects and their audit functionality enabling us to detect pre-existing conflicts and issues. Although Kubernetes incorporates the concepts of secrets, they are only base64 encoded and are not dynamically configured. This is where Vault comes into play: Vault dynamically secures, stores, and tightly controls access to sensitive data. This way, the secret information is encrypted, secured, and centralized, making it more scalable and easier to manage. Thus, the implementation of these three security features corroborate the enhanced security and reliability of the CMSWEB Kubernetes infrastructure.",

However, given the high sensitivity of the industry to the security of industrial control system networks and IIoT, the use of software-defined networking (SDN) technology can provide improved security and automation of communication processes. Despite this, the architecture of SDN can give rise to various security threats. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider the impact of these threats on SDN-based IIoT environments. Unlike previous research, which focused on security in IIoT and SDN architectures separately, we propose an integrated method including two components that work together seamlessly for better detecting and preventing security threats associated with SDN-based IIoT architectures. The two components consist in a convolutional neural network-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) implemented as an SDN application and a Blockchain-based system (BS) to empower application layer and network layer security, respectively. A significant advantage of the proposed method lies in jointly minimizing the impact of attacks such as command injection and rule injection on SDN-based IIoT architecture layers. The proposed IDS exhibits superior classification accuracy in both binary and multiclass categories.",

      "abstract": "The (logically) centralised architecture of the software-defined networks makes them an easy target for packet injection attacks. In these attacks, the attacker injects malicious packets into the SDN network to affect the services and performance of the SDN controller and overflow the capacity of the SDN switches. Such attacks have been shown to ultimately stop the network functioning in real-time, leading to network breakdowns. There have been significant works on detecting and defending against similar DoS attacks in non-SDN networks, but detection and protection techniques for SDN against packet injection attacks are still in their infancy. Furthermore, many of the proposed solutions have been shown to be easily by-passed by simple modifications to the attacking packets or by altering the attacking profile. In this paper, we develop novel Graph Convolutional Neural Network models and algorithms for grouping network nodes/users into security classes by learning from network data. We start with two simple classes - nodes that engage in suspicious packet injection attacks and nodes that are not. From these classes, we then partition the network into separate segments with different security policies using distributed Ryu controllers in an SDN network. We show in experiments on an emulated SDN that our detection solution outperforms alternative approaches with above 99\\% detection accuracy on various types (both old and new) of injection attacks. More importantly, our mitigation solution maintains continuous functions of non-compromised nodes while isolating compromised/suspicious nodes in real-time.

      "abstract": "Software-defined networking (SDN) has been widely utilized to enforce the security of traditional networks, thereby promoting the process of transforming traditional networks into SDN networks. However, SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms rely heavily on the security policies containing the underlying information of data plane. With increasing the scale of underlying network, the current security policy management mechanism will confront more and more challenges. The security policy transformation for SDN networks is to research how to transform the high-level security policy without containing the underlying information of data plane into the practical flow entries used by the OpenFlow switches automatically, thereby implementing the automation of security policy management. Based on this insight, a practical runtime security policy transformation framework is proposed in this paper. First of all, we specify the security policies used by SDN networks as a system model of security policy (SPM). From the theoretical level, we establish the system model for SDN network and propose a formal method to transform SPM into the system model of flow entries automatically. From the practical level, we propose a runtime security policy transformation framework to solve the problem of how to find a connected path for each relationship of SPM in the data plane, as well as how to generate the practical flow entries according to the system model of flow entries. In order to validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the framework, we set up an experimental system and implement the framework with POX controller and Mininet emulator.",

In order to reduce the time for finding a subset of the right rules in the vast array of all rules on traffic filtering systems that are logically located on sensors, a method of processing and filtering traffic in 5G and 6G transport networks is proposed. This method is based on DPDK with the LPM algorithm and is capable of processing up to 8 megapackets per second on 1 CPU core; the packet processing takes O(1), which is significantly lower than with similar algorithms. The managing subsystem consists of regional monitoring centres and a main one. The main Monitoring Centre includes a main cluster of SDN controllers along with Active/Active redundancy scheme. The regional centres represent SDN software controllers that manage locally subordinate sensors. All the managing centres are interconnected via the Transport subsystem and form a network. An algorithm for network sensor load balancing between SDN controllers has been developed in order to provide fault tolerance, load balancing and network connectivity. The algorithm results in a set of optimal sensor groups with total load not exceeding the maximum capacity of the SDN controllers.",

      "abstract": "Software-Defined Network (SDN) is a new arising terminology of network architecture with outstanding features of orchestration by decoupling the control plane and the data plane in each network element. Even though it brings several benefits, SDN is vulnerable to a diversity of attacks. Abusing the single point of failure in the SDN controller component, hackers can shut down all network operations. More specifics, a malicious OpenFlow application can access to SDN controller to carry out harmful actions without any limitation owing to the lack of the access control mechanism as a standard in the Northbound. The sensitive information about the whole network such as network topology, flow information, and statistics can be gathered and leaked out. Even worse, the entire network can be taken over by the compromised controller. Hence, it is vital to build a scheme of access control for SDN's Northbound. Furthermore, it must also protect the data integrity and availability during data exchange between application and controller. To address such limitations, we introduce B-DAC, a blockchain-based framework for decentralized authentication and fine-grained access control for the Northbound interface to assist administrators in managing and protecting critical resources. With strict policy enforcement, B-DAC can perform decentralized access control for each request to keep network applications under surveillance for preventing over-privileged activities or security policy conflicts. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we also implement a prototype of this framework to evaluate the security impact, effectiveness, and performance through typical use cases.",

      "abstract": "Network slicing and resource allocation play pivotal roles in software-defined network (SDN)/network function virtualization (NFV)-assisted 5G networks. In 5G communications, the traffic rate is high, necessitating high data rates and low latency. Deep learning is a potential solution for overcoming these constraints. Secure slicing avoids resource wastage; however, DDoS attackers can exploit the sliced network. Therefore, we focused on secure slicing with resource allocation under massive network traffic. Traffic-aware scheduling is proposed for secure slicing and resource allocation over SDN/NFV-enabled 5G networks. In this approach (T-S3RA), user devices are authenticated using Boolean logic with a password-based key derivation function. The traffic is scheduled in 5G access points, and secure network slicing and resource allocation are implemented using deep learning models such as SliceNet and HopFieldNet, respectively. To predict DDoS attackers, we computed the Renyi entropy for packet classification. Experiments were conducted using a network simulator with 250 nodes in the network topology. Performance was evaluated using metrics such as throughput, latency, packet transmission ratio, packet loss ratio, slice capacity, bandwidth consumption, and slice acceptance ratio. T-S3RA was implemented in three 5G use cases with different requirements including massive machine-type communication, ultrareliable low-latency communication, and enhanced mobile broadband.",

      "abstract": "Aiming at the privacy preservation of dynamic Web service composition, this paper proposes a SDN-based runtime security enforcement approach for privacy preservation of dynamic Web service composition. The main idea of this approach is that the owner of service composition leverages the security policy model (SPM) to define the access control relationships that service composition must comply with in the application plane, then SPM model is transformed into the low-level security policy model (RSPM) containing the information of SDN data plane, and RSPM model is uploaded into the SDN controller. After uploading, the virtual machine access control algorithm integrated in the SDN controller monitors all of access requests towards service composition at runtime. Only the access requests that meet the definition of RSPM model can be forwarded to the target terminal. Any access requests that do not meet the definition of RSPM model will be automatically blocked by Openflow switches or deleted by SDN controller, Thus, this approach can effectively solve the problems of network-layer illegal accesses, identity theft attacks and service leakages when Web service composition is running. In order to verify the feasibility of this approach, this paper implements an experimental system by using POX controller and Mininet virtual network simulator, and evaluates the effectiveness and performance of this approach by using this system. The final experimental results show that the method is completely effective, and the method can always get the correct calculation results in an acceptable time when the scale of RSPM model is gradually increasing.",

In an SDN network, routing and traffic management decisions are made by a centralized controller and communicated to switches via a control channel. Transport Layer Security (TLS) has been proposed as its single security layer; however, use of TLS is optional and connections are still vulnerable to downgrade attacks. In this paper, we propose the strengthening of security assurance using a protocol dialecting approach to provide additional and customizable security. We consider and evaluate two dialecting approaches for OpenFlow protocol operation, adding per-message authentication to the SDN control channel that is independent of TLS and provides robustness against downgrade attacks in the optional case of TLS implementation. Furthermore, we measure the performance impact of using these dialecting primitives in a Mininet experiment. The results show a modest increase of communication latency of less than 22%.",

By means of SOM-based DDoS defense mechanism, the gateway can effectively identify the malicious sensing devices in the IoT, and automatically block those malicious devices after detecting them, so that it can effectively enforce the security and robustness of the system when it is under DDoS attacks.

This splitting causes many issues in SDN, such as vulnerabilities of DDoS attacks. Many solutions (including blockchain based) have been proposed to overcome these problems. In this work, we offer a blockchain-based solution that is provided in redundant SDN (load-balanced) to service millions of IoT devices. Blockchain is considered as tamper-proof and impossible to corrupt due to the replication of the ledger and consensus for verification and addition to the ledger. Therefore, it is a perfect fit for SDN in IoT Networks. Blockchain technology provides everyone with a working proof of decentralized trust.

Unlike the traditional methods, in this framework, there is no need to change the infrastructures like SIP servers or SIP load balancer to implement the distribution method.

However, the central controller poses a bottleneck that can become an attack target, and processing context changes at remote software has low agility.   We present a new paradigm, programmable in-network security (Poise), which is enabled by the emergence of programmable switches. At the heart of Poise is a novel switch primitive, which can be programmed to support a wide range of context-aware policies in hardware. Users of Poise specify concise policies, and Poise compiles them into different instantiations of the security primitive in P4. Compared to centralized SDN defenses, Poise is resilient to control plane saturation attacks, and it dramatically increases defense agility.",

As a malfunction in the controller software may lead to a collapse of the network, assessing the security of solutions before their deployment, is a major concern in SDNs. In light of this, we have conducted a comprehensive review of the literature on the experimental security analysis of the control plane in SDNs, with an emphasis on vulnerabilities of the controller software. Additionally, we have introduced a taxonomy of the techniques found in the literature with regard to the experimental security analysis of SDN controller software. Furthermore, a comparative study has been carried out of existing experimental approaches considering the security requirements defined by the Open Network Foundation (ONF).

However, the traffic handled by VSNFs could be sensitive to specific network requirements, such as minimum bandwidth or maximum end-to-end latency. Therefore, the decision on which VSNFs should apply for a given application, where to place them and how to connect them, should take such requirements into consideration. Otherwise, security services could affect the quality of service experienced by customers. In this paper we propose PESS (Progressive Embedding of Security Services), a solution to efficiently deploy chains of virtualised security functions based on the security requirements of individual applications and operators' policies, while optimizing resource utilization. We provide the PESS mathematical model and heuristic solution. Simulation results show that, compared to state-of-the-art application-agnostic VSNF provisioning models, PESS reduces computational resource utilization by up to 50%, in different network scenarios. This result ultimately leads to a higher number of provisioned security services and to up to a 40% reduction in end-to-end latency of application traffic.",

They are driven by the evolution in Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). This shows that software will play an increasingly important role within telecommunication services, which were previously dominated by hardware appliances. Service providers can benefit from this, as it enables faster introduction of new telecom services, combined with an agile set of possibilities to optimize and fine-tune their operations. However, the provided telecom services can only evolve if the adequate software tools are available. In this article, we explain how the development, deployment and maintenance of such an SDN/NFV-based telecom service puts specific requirements on the platform providing it. A Software Development Kit (SDK) is introduced, allowing service providers to adequately design, test and evaluate services before they are deployed in production and also update them during their lifetime. This continuous cycle between development and operations, a concept known as DevOps, is a well known strategy in software development. To extend its context further to SDN/NFV-based services, the functionalities provided by traditional cloud platforms are not yet sufficient. By giving an overview of the currently available tools and their limitations, the gaps in DevOps for SDN/NFV services are highlighted. The benefit of such an SDK is illustrated by a secure content delivery network service (enhanced with deep packet inspection and elastic routing capabilities). With this use-case, the dynamics between developing and deploying a service are further illustrated.",

Yet, the naive deployment of SDN on the Internet raises concerns about the correctness of the inter-domain data-plane. By allowing operators to deflect traffic from the default BGP route, SDN policies are susceptible of creating permanent forwarding loops invisible to the control-plane.   In this paper, we propose a system, called Prelude, for detecting SDN-induced forwarding loops between SDXes with high accuracy without leaking the private routing information of network operators. To achieve this, we leverage Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) techniques to build a novel and general privacy-preserving primitive that detects whether any subset of SDN rules might affect the same portion of traffic without learning anything about those rules. We then leverage that primitive as the main building block of a distributed system tailored to detect forwarding loops among any set of SDXes. We leverage the particular nature of SDXes to further improve the efficiency of our SMPC solution.   The number of valid SDN rules, i.e., not creating loops, rejected by our solution is 100x lower than previous privacy-preserving solutions, and also provides better privacy guarantees. Furthermore, our solution naturally provides network operators with some hindsight on the cost of the deflected paths.",

Software Defined Networks (SDN) offer a promising approach to meeting some of these challenges. In this paper, we propose a policy driven security architecture for securing end to end services across multiple SDN domains. We develop a language based approach to design security policies that are relevant for securing SDN services and communications. We describe the policy language and its use in specifying security policies to control the flow of information in a multi-domain SDN. We demonstrate the specification of fine grained security policies based on a variety of attributes such as parameters associated with users and devices/switches, context information such as location and routing information, and services accessed in SDN as well as security attributes associated with the switches and Controllers in different domains. An important feature of our architecture is its ability to specify path and flow based security policies, which are significant for securing end to end services in SDNs. We describe the design and the implementation of our proposed policy based security architecture and demonstrate its use in scenarios involving both intra and inter-domain communications with multiple SDN Controllers. We analyse the performance characteristics of our architecture as well as discuss how our architecture is able to counteract various security attacks. The dynamic security policy based approach and the distribution of corresponding security capabilities intelligently as a service layer that enable flow based security enforcement and protection of multitude of network devices against attacks are important contributions of this paper.",

We observe that many attacks to IoTs are launched in a collusive way, such as brute-force hacking usernames and passwords, to target at a particular victim. However, most of the time our defending mechanisms to such kind of attacks are carried out individually and independently, which leads to ineffective and weak defense. To this end, we propose to leverage Software Defined Networks (SDN) to enable cooperative security for legacy IP-based IoT devices. SDN decouples control plane and data plane, and can help bridge the knowledge divided between the application and network layers. In this paper, we discuss the IoT security problems and challenges, and present an SDN-based architecture to enable IoT security in a cooperative manner. Furthermore, we implemented a platform that can quickly share the attacking information with peer controllers and block the attacks. We carried out our experiments in both virtual and physical SDN environments with OpenFlow switches. Our evaluation results show that both environments can scale well to handle attacks, but hardware implementation is much more efficient than a virtual one.",

Compromising the models is consequently a very desirable goal. Previous surveys have been done on either adversarial machine learning or the general vulnerabilities of SDNs but not both. Through examination of the latest ML-based SDN security applications and a good look at ML/SDN specific vulnerabilities accompanied by common attack methods on ML, this paper serves as a unique survey, making a case for more secure development processes of ML-based SDN security applications.",

From a security perspective, SDN separates security concerns into control and data plane, and this architectural recomposition brings up exciting opportunities and challenges. The overall perception is that SDN capabilities will ultimately result in improved security. However, in its raw form, SDN could potentially make networks more vulnerable to attacks and harder to protect. In this paper, we focus on identifying challenges faced in securing the data plane of SDN - one of the least explored but most critical components of this technology. We formalize this problem space, identify potential attack scenarios while highlighting possible vulnerabilities and establish a set of requirements and challenges to protect the data plane of SDNs. Moreover, we undertake a survey of existing solutions with respect to the identified threats, identifying their limitations and offer future research directions.",

      "abstract": "While the centralization of SDN brought advantages such as a faster pace of innovation, it also disrupted some of the natural defenses of traditional architectures against different threats. The literature on SDN has mostly been concerned with the functional side, despite some specific works concerning non-functional properties like 'security' or 'dependability'. Though addressing the latter in an ad-hoc, piecemeal way, may work, it will most likely lead to efficiency and effectiveness problems. We claim that the enforcement of non-functional properties as a pillar of SDN robustness calls for a systemic approach. As a general concept, we propose ANCHOR, a subsystem architecture that promotes the logical centralization of non-functional properties. To show the effectiveness of the concept, we focus on 'security' in this paper: we identify the current security gaps in SDNs and we populate the architecture middleware with the appropriate security mechanisms, in a global and consistent manner. Essential security mechanisms provided by anchor include reliable entropy and resilient pseudo-random generators, and protocols for secure registration and association of SDN devices. We claim and justify in the paper that centralizing such mechanisms is key for their effectiveness, by allowing us to: define and enforce global policies for those properties; reduce the complexity of controllers and forwarding devices; ensure higher levels of robustness for critical services; foster interoperability of the non-functional property enforcement mechanisms; and promote the security and resilience of the architecture itself. We discuss design and implementation aspects, and we prove and evaluate our algorithms and mechanisms, including the formalisation of the main protocols and the verification of their core security properties using the Tamarin prover.",

In this paper, we introduce and detail a novel protocol called secure and efficient OpenFlow Discovery Protocol sOTDP. sOFTDP requires minimal changes to OpenFlow switch design, eliminates major vulnerabilities in the topology discovery process and improves its performance. We have implemented sOFTDP as a topology discovery module in Floodlight for evaluation. The results show that our implementation is more secure than OFDP and previous security workarounds.

This architectural difference implies a different design for control functions necessary for essential network properties, e.g., loop prevention and link redundancy. We explore how such differences redefine the security weaknesses in the SDN control plane and provide a framework for comparative analysis which focuses on essential network properties required by typical production networks. This enables analysis of how these properties are delivered by the control planes of SDN and conventional networks, and to compare security risks and mitigations. Despite the architectural difference, we find similar, but not identical, exposures in control plane security if both network paradigms provide the same network properties and are analyzed under the same threat model. However, defenses vary; SDN cannot depend on edge based filtering to protect its control plane, while this is arguably the primary defense in conventional networks. Our concrete security analysis suggests that a distributed SDN architecture that supports fault tolerance and consistency checks is important for SDN control plane security. Our analysis methodology may be of independent interest for future security analysis of SDN and conventional networks.",

An attacker (e.g., a malicious switch in the data plane or a host connected to the network) can use teleportation to transmit information via the control plane and bypass critical network functions in the data plane (e.g., a firewall), and to violate security policies as well as logical and even physical separations. This paper characterizes the design space for teleportation attacks theoretically, and then identifies four different teleportation techniques. We demonstrate and discuss how these techniques can be exploited for different attacks (e.g., exfiltrating confidential data at high rates), and also initiate the discussion of possible countermeasures. Generally, and given today's trend toward more intent-based networking, we believe that our findings are relevant beyond the use cases considered in this paper.",

Multi-domain SDN centralization can be realized by outsourcing routing functions to an external contractor, which provides inter-domain routing services facilitated through a multi-AS network controller. The proposed model promises to become a vehicle for evolving BGP and uses the bird's eye view over several networks to benefit aspects of inter-domain routing, such as convergence properties, policy conflict resolution, inter-domain troubleshooting, and collaborative security. In addition to the proposed paradigm, we introduce a publicly available emulation platform built on top of Mininet and the Quagga routing software, for experimenting in hybrid BGP-SDN AS-level networks. As a proof of concept we focus specifically on exploiting multi-domain centralization to improve BGP's slow convergence. We build and make publicly available a first multi-AS controller tailored to this use case and demonstrate experimentally that SDN centralization helps to linearly reduce BGP convergence times and churn rates with expanding SDN deployments.",

However, we believe important security aspects of SDN are still left uninvestigated. In this paper, we raise the concern of the possibility for an attacker to obtain knowledge about an SDN network. In particular, we introduce a novel attack, named Know Your Enemy (KYE), by means of which an attacker can gather vital information about the configuration of the network. This information ranges from the configuration of security tools, such as attack detection thresholds for network scanning, to general network policies like QoS and network virtualization. Additionally, we show that an attacker can perform a KYE attack in a stealthy fashion, i.e., without the risk of being detected. We underline that the vulnerability exploited by the KYE attack is proper of SDN and is not present in legacy networks. To address the KYE attack, we also propose an active defense countermeasure based on network flows obfuscation, which considerably increases the complexity for a successful attack. Our solution offers provable security guarantees that can be tailored to the needs of the specific network under consideration",

This paper presents SDNsec, an SDN security extension that provides forwarding accountability for the SDN data plane. Forwarding rules are encoded in the packet, ensuring consistent network behavior during reconfigurations and limiting state exhaustion attacks due to table lookups. Symmetric-key cryptography is used to protect the integrity of the forwarding rules and enforce them at each switch. A complementary path validation mechanism allows the controller to reactively examine the actual path taken by the packets. Furthermore, we present mechanisms for secure link-failure recovery and multicast/broadcast forwarding.",

      "abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN), has introduced many advanced platforms for managing networks and adopting different security tools with them, but the cost of these platforms should be considered as well. In this paper, we present an extension of the existing approach to the optimal placement of virtual security appliances in a pre-defined network setting. The approach proposed by Bouet [1] only considered one security appliance, we extended his approach to several virtual security appliances. We conducted several simulation tests showing good performances of our approach. To show the feasibility, we implemented our approach using SDN and virtual security appliances and integrated it into OpenStack. This extension adapts UFLP algorithm to real world situations where several middle boxes need to be deployed to satisfy security needs for the applications deployed in the cloud. We realized this approach by implementing \"OpenStack on top of OpenStack\" , a nested OpenStack implementation with OpenDayLight as the SDN controller .",
