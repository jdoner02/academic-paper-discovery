      "abstract": "IoT application providers increasingly use MicroService Architecture (MSA) to develop applications that convert IoT data into valuable information. The independently deployable and scalable nature of microservices enables dynamic utilization of edge and cloud resources provided by various service providers, thus improving performance. However, IoT data security should be ensured during multi-domain data processing and transmission among distributed and dynamically composed microservices. The ability to implement granular security controls at the microservices level has the potential to solve this. To this end, edge-cloud environments require intricate and scalable security frameworks that operate across multi-domain environments to enforce various security policies during the management of microservices (i.e., initial placement, scaling, migration, and dynamic composition), considering the sensitivity of the IoT data. To address the lack of such a framework, we propose an architectural framework that uses Policy-as-Code to ensure secure microservice management within multi-domain edge-cloud environments. The proposed framework contains a \"control plane\" to intelligently and dynamically utilise and configure cloud-native (i.e., container orchestrators and service mesh) technologies to enforce security policies. We implement a prototype of the proposed framework using open-source cloud-native technologies such as Docker, Kubernetes, Istio, and Open Policy Agent to validate the framework. Evaluations verify our proposed framework's ability to enforce security policies for distributed microservices management, thus harvesting the MSA characteristics to ensure IoT application security needs.",

The process is scalable because we optimize for multi-node, high-throughput computing. The process is secure because users are forced to operate with unprivileged profiles meaning administrators control the access permissions.

This study compares Kubernetes and these lightweight distributions by evaluating security compliance using kube-bench, simulating network outages to assess resiliency, and documenting maintainability. Results indicate that while k3s and k0s offer superior ease of development due to their simplicity, they have lower security compliance compared to Kubernetes, KubeEdge, and OpenYurt. Kubernetes provides a balanced approach but may be resource-intensive for edge deployments. KubeEdge and OpenYurt enhance security features and reliability under network outages but increase complexity and resource consumption. The findings highlight trade-offs between performance, security, resiliency, and maintainability, offering insights for practitioners deploying Kubernetes in edge environments.",

Like any other software system, securing CO is critical, but can be quite challenging task due to large number of configurable options. Manual configuration is not only knowledge intensive and time consuming, but also is error prone. For automating security configuration of CO, we propose a novel Knowledge Graph based Security Configuration, KGSecConfig, approach. Our solution leverages keyword and learning models to systematically capture, link, and correlate heterogeneous and multi-vendor configuration space in a unified structure for supporting automation of security configuration of CO. We implement KGSecConfig on Kubernetes, Docker, Azure, and VMWare to build secured configuration knowledge graph. Our evaluation results show 0.98 and 0.94 accuracy for keyword and learning-based secured configuration option and concept extraction, respectively. We also demonstrate the utilization of the knowledge graph for automated misconfiguration mitigation in a Kubernetes cluster. We assert that our knowledge graph based approach can help in addressing several challenges, e.g., misconfiguration of security, associated with manually configuring the security of CO.",

We gathered security insights from Kubernetes practitioners and transformed the data through machine learning algorithms for cleaning and topic clustering. Subsequently, we used advanced AI tools to automatically generate topic descriptions, thereby reducing the analysis process. In our analysis, security-related posts ranked as the fourth most prevalent topic in these forums, comprising 12.3% of the overall discussions. Furthermore, the findings indicated that although the frequency of security discussions has remained constant, their popularity and influence have experienced significant growth. Kubernetes users consistently prioritize security topics, and the rising popularity of security posts reflects a growing interest and concern for maintaining secure Kubernetes clusters.

Docker images are one of the most popular container technologies for building and deploying containers. A container image usually includes a collection of software packages, that can have bugs and security vulnerabilities that affect the container health. Our goal is to support container deployers by analysing the relation between outdated containers and vulnerable and buggy packages installed in them. We use the concept of technical lag of a container as the difference between a given container and the most up-to-date container that is possible with the most recent releases of the same collection of packages. For 7,380 official and community Docker images that are based on the Debian Linux distribution, we identify which software packages are installed in them and measure their technical lag in terms of version updates, security vulnerabilities and bugs. We have found, among others, that no release is devoid of vulnerabilities, so deployers cannot avoid vulnerabilities even if they deploy the most recent packages. We offer some lessons learned for container developers in regard to the strategies they can follow to minimize the number of vulnerabilities. We argue that Docker container scan and security management tools should improve their platforms by adding data about other kinds of bugs and include the measurement of technical lag to offer deployers information of when to update.",

Developers, in turn, lack a means for expressing and automatically enforcing high-level application security requirements at deployment time. In this paper, we observe that orchestration systems are ideally situated between developers and the cloud provider to address these issues. We propose a security policy framework that enables security-oriented orchestration of microservices by capturing and auditing code properties that are incorporated into microservice code throughout the software supply chain. Orchestrators can leverage these properties to deploy microservices on a node that matches both the developer's and cloud provider's security policy and their resource requirements.

      "abstract": "Container technologies, like Docker, are becoming increasingly popular. Containers provide exceptional developer experience because containers offer lightweight isolation and ease of software distribution. Containers are also widely used in production environments, where a different set of challenges arise such as security, networking, service discovery and load balancing. Container cluster management tools, such as Kubernetes, attempt to solve these problems by introducing a new control layer with the container as the unit of deployment. However, adding a new control layer is an extra configuration step and an additional potential source of runtime errors. The virtual machine technology offered by cloud providers is more mature and proven in terms of security, networking, service discovery and load balancing. However, virtual machines are heavier than containers for local development, are less flexible for resource allocation, and suffer longer boot times. This paper presents an alternative to containers that enjoy the best features of both approaches: (1) the use of mature, proven cloud vendor technology; (2) no need for a new control layer; and (3) as lightweight as containers. Our solution is i2kit, a deployment tool based on the immutable infrastructure pattern, where the virtual machine is the unit of deployment. The i2kit tool accepts a simplified format of Kubernetes Deployment Manifests in order to reuse Kubernetes' most successful principles, but it creates a lightweight virtual machine for each Pod using Linuxkit. Linuxkit alleviates the drawback in size that using virtual machines would otherwise entail, because the footprint of Linuxkit is approximately 60MB. Finally, the attack surface of the system is reduced since Linuxkit only installs the minimum set of OS dependencies to run containers, and different Pods are isolated by hypervisor technology.",

      "abstract": "The CMSWEB cluster is pivotal to the activities of the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment, as it hosts critical services required for the operational needs of the CMS experiment. The security of these services and the corresponding data is crucial to CMS. Any malicious attack can compromise the availability of our services. Therefore, it is important to construct a robust security infrastructure. In this work, we discuss new security features introduced to the CMSWEB Kubernetes (\"k8s\") cluster. The new features include the implementation of network policies, deployment of Open Policy Agent (OPA), enforcement of OPA policies, and the integration of Vault. The network policies act as an inside-the-cluster firewall to limit the network communication between the pods to the minimum necessary, and its dynamic nature allows us to work with microservices. The OPA validates the objects against some custom-defined policies during create, update, and delete operations to further enhance security. Without recompiling or changing the configuration of the Kubernetes API server, it can apply customized policies on Kubernetes objects and their audit functionality enabling us to detect pre-existing conflicts and issues. Although Kubernetes incorporates the concepts of secrets, they are only base64 encoded and are not dynamically configured. This is where Vault comes into play: Vault dynamically secures, stores, and tightly controls access to sensitive data. This way, the secret information is encrypted, secured, and centralized, making it more scalable and easier to manage. Thus, the implementation of these three security features corroborate the enhanced security and reliability of the CMSWEB Kubernetes infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Cyber Security is a critical topic for organizations with IT/OT networks as they are always susceptible to attack, whether insider or outsider. Since the cyber landscape is an ever-evolving scenario, one must keep upgrading its security systems to enhance the security of the infrastructure. Tools like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Information Technology Service Management (ITSM), along with other defensive techniques like Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Protection System (IPS), and many others enhance the cyber security posture of the infrastructure. However, the proposed protection mechanisms have their limitations, they are insufficient to ensure security, and the attacker penetrates the network. Deception technology, along with Honeypots, provides a false sense of vulnerability in the target systems to the attackers. The attacker deceived reveals threat intel about their modus operandi. We have developed a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Engine that dynamically deploys custom honeypots inside the internal network infrastructure based on the attacker's behavior. The architecture is robust enough to support multiple VLANs connected to the system and used for orchestration. The presence of botnet traffic and DDOS attacks on the honeypots in the network is detected, along with a malware collection system. After being exposed to live traffic for four days, our engine dynamically orchestrated the honeypots 40 times, detected 7823 attacks, 965 DDOS attack packets, and three malicious samples. While our experiments with static honeypots show an average attacker engagement time of 102 seconds per instance, our SOAR Engine-based dynamic honeypots engage attackers on average 3148 seconds.",

      "abstract": "Software development industries are increasingly adopting containers to enhance the scalability and flexibility of software applications. Security in containerized projects is a critical challenge that can lead to data breaches and performance degradation, thereby directly affecting the reliability and operations of the container services. Despite the ongoing effort to manage the security issues in containerized projects in software engineering (SE) research, more focused investigations are needed to explore the human perspective of security management and the technical approaches to security management in containerized projects. This research aims to explore security management in containerized projects by exploring how SE practitioners perceive the security issues in containerized software projects and their approach to managing such issues. A clear understanding of security management in containerized projects will enable industries to develop robust security strategies that enhance software reliability and trust. To achieve this, we conducted two separate semi-structured interview studies to examine how practitioners approach security management. The first study focused on practitioners perceptions of security challenges in containerized environments, where we interviewed 15 participants between December 2022 and October 2023. The second study explored how to enhance container security, with 20 participants interviewed between October 2024 and December 2024. Analyzing the data from both studies reveals how SE practitioners address the various security challenges in containerized projects. Our analysis also identified the technical and non-technical enablers that can be utilized to enhance security.",

      "abstract": "Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software Distributed Networking (SDN) technologies play a crucial role in enabling 5G system and beyond. A synergy between these both technologies has been identified for enabling a new concept dubbed service function chains (SFC) that aims to reduce both the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX). The SFC paradigm considers different constraints and key performance indicators (KPIs), that includes QoS and different resources, for enabling network slice services. However, the large-scale, complexity and security issues brought by these technologies create an extra overhead for ensuring secure network slicing. To cope with these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-efficient optimized SFC management system that enables the creation of SFCs for enabling efficient and secure network slices. The proposed system considers the network and computational resources and current network security levels to ensure trusted deployments. The simulation results demonstrated the efficiency of the proposed solution for achieving its designed objectives. The proposed solution efficiently manages the SFCs by optimizing deployment costs and reducing overall end-to-end delay",

      "abstract": "Large language model powered autonomous agents demand robust, standardized protocols to integrate tools, share contextual data, and coordinate tasks across heterogeneous systems. Ad-hoc integrations are difficult to scale, secure, and generalize across domains. This survey examines four emerging agent communication protocols: Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent-to-Agent Protocol (A2A), and Agent Network Protocol (ANP), each addressing interoperability in deployment contexts. MCP provides a JSON-RPC client-server interface for secure tool invocation and typed data exchange. ACP defines a general-purpose communication protocol over RESTful HTTP, supporting MIME-typed multipart messages and synchronous and asynchronous interactions. Its lightweight and runtime-independent design enables scalable agent invocation, while features like session management, message routing, and integration with role-based and decentralized identifiers (DIDs). A2A enables peer-to-peer task delegation using capability-based Agent Cards, supporting secure and scalable collaboration across enterprise agent workflows. ANP supports open network agent discovery and secure collaboration using W3C decentralized identifiers DIDs and JSON-LD graphs. The protocols are compared across multiple dimensions, including interaction modes, discovery mechanisms, communication patterns, and security models. Based on the comparative analysis, a phased adoption roadmap is proposed: beginning with MCP for tool access, followed by ACP for structured, multimodal messaging session-aware interaction and both online and offline agent discovery across scalable, HTTP-based deployments A2A for collaborative task execution, and extending to ANP for decentralized agent marketplaces. This work provides a comprehensive foundation for designing secure, interoperable, and scalable ecosystems of LLM-powered agents.",

      "abstract": "Open software ecosystems are beneficial for customers; they benefit from 3rd party services and applications, e.g. analysis of data using apps, developed and deployed by other companies or open-source communities. One significant advantage of this approach is that other customers may benefit from these newly developed applications as well. Especially software ecosystems utilizing container technologies are prone to certain risks. Docker, in particular, is more vulnerable to attacks than hypervisor based virtualisation as it directly operates on the host system. Docker is a popular representative of containerisation technology which offers a lightweight architecture in order to facilitate the set-up and creation of such software ecosystems. Popular Infrastructure as a Service cloud service providers, like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, jump on the containerisation bandwagon and provide interfaces for provisioning and managing containers. Companies can benefit from that change of technology and create software ecosystems more efficiently. In this paper, we present a new concept for significant security improvements for cloud-based software ecosystems using Docker for 3rd party app integration. Based on the security features of Docker we describe a secure integration of applications in the cloud environment securely. Our approach considers the whole software lifecycle and includes sandbox testing of potentially dangerous 3rd party apps before these became available to the customers.",

However, there has been no effort to systematically review and analyze the reported solutions. We report a Multivocal Literature Review that has systematically selected and reviewed both academic and grey (blogs, web pages, white papers) literature on different aspects of security orchestration published from January 2007 until July 2017. The review has enabled us to provide a working definition of security orchestration and classify the main functionalities of security orchestration into three main areas: unification, orchestration, and automation. We have also identified the core components of a security orchestration platform and categorized the drivers of security orchestration based on technical and socio-technical aspects. We also provide a taxonomy of security orchestration based on the execution environment, automation strategy, deployment type, mode of task and resource type.

Docker is a leading provider of containerisation, and through the Docker Hub, users can supply Docker images for sharing and re-purposing popular software application containers.

In this paper we present \\textbf{\\textit{gh0stEdit}}, a vulnerability that fundamentally undermines the integrity of Docker images and subverts the assumed trust and transparency they utilise. The use of gh0stEdit allows an attacker to maliciously edit Docker images, in a way that is not shown within the image history, hierarchy or commands. This attack can also be carried out against signed images (Docker Content Trust) without invalidating the image signature. We present two use case studies for this vulnerability, and showcase how gh0stEdit is able to poison an image in a way that is not picked up through static or dynamic scanning tools. Our attack case studies highlight the issues in the current approach to Docker image security and trust, and expose an attack method which could potentially be exploited in the wild without being detected.

A growing body of literature is found addressing security threats and security mechanisms to individual microservices and microservice architectures. The aim of this study is to provide a helpful guide to developers about already recognized threats on microservices and how they can be detected, mitigated or prevented; we also aim to identify potential research gaps on securing MSA. In this paper, we conduct a systematic mapping in order to categorize threats on MSA with their security proposals. Therefore, we extracted threats and details of proposed solutions reported in selected studies. Obtained results are used to design a lightweight ontology for security patterns of MSA. The ontology can be queried to identify source of threats, security mechanisms used to prevent each threat, applicability layer and validation techniques used for each mechanism. The systematic search yielded 1067 studies of which 46 are selected as primary studies. The results of the mapping revealed an unbalanced research focus in favor of external attacks; auditing and enforcing access control are the most investigated techniques compared with prevention and mitigation. Additionally, we found that most proposed solutions are soft-infrastructure applicable layer compared with other layers such as communication and deployment. We also found that performance analysis and case studies are the most used validation techniques of security proposals.",

Industry guidelines for agentic system governance emphasize the need for users to maintain comprehensive control over their agents, mitigating potential damage from malicious agents. Several proposed agentic system designs address agent identity, authorization, and delegation, but remain purely theoretical, without concrete implementation and evaluation. Most importantly, they do not provide user-controlled agent management. To address this gap, we propose SAGA, a Security Architecture for Governing Agentic systems, that offers user oversight over their agents' lifecycle. In our design, users register their agents with a central entity, the Provider, that maintains agents contact information, user-defined access control policies, and helps agents enforce these policies on inter-agent communication. We introduce a cryptographic mechanism for deriving access control tokens, that offers fine-grained control over an agent's interaction with other agents, balancing security and performance consideration. We evaluate SAGA on several agentic tasks, using agents in different geolocations, and multiple on-device and cloud LLMs, demonstrating minimal performance overhead with no impact on underlying task utility in a wide range of conditions. Our architecture enables secure and trustworthy deployment of autonomous agents, accelerating the responsible adoption of this technology in sensitive environments.",

This is a technology, which packages an application, its dependencies and Operating System (OS) to run as an isolated unit. However, the pressing concern with the use of containers is its susceptibility to security attacks. Consequently, a number of container scanning tools are available for detecting container security vulnerabilities. Therefore, in this study, we investigate the quality of existing container scanning tools by proposing two metrics that reflects coverage and accuracy. We analyze 59 popular public container images for Java applications hosted on DockerHub using different container scanning tools (such as Clair, Anchore, and Microscanner). Our findings show that existing container scanning approach does not detect application package vulnerabilities. Furthermore, existing tools do not have high accuracy, since 34% vulnerabilities are being missed by the best performing tool. Finally, we also demonstrate quality of Docker images for Java applications hosted on DockerHub by assessing complete vulnerability landscape i.e., number of vulnerabilities detected in images.",

      "abstract": "The rapid adoption of agentic AI, powered by large language models (LLMs), is transforming enterprise ecosystems with autonomous agents that execute complex workflows. Yet we observe several key security vulnerabilities in LLM-driven multi-agent systems (MASes): fragmented identity frameworks, insecure communication channels, and inadequate defenses against Byzantine agents or adversarial prompts. In this paper, we present the first systematic analysis of these emerging multi-agent risks and explain why the legacy security strategies cannot effectively address these risks. Afterwards, we propose BlockA2A, the first unified multi-agent trust framework that enables secure and verifiable and agent-to-agent interoperability. At a high level, BlockA2A adopts decentralized identifiers (DIDs) to enable fine-grained cross-domain agent authentication, blockchain-anchored ledgers to enable immutable auditability, and smart contracts to dynamically enforce context-aware access control policies. BlockA2A eliminates centralized trust bottlenecks, ensures message authenticity and execution integrity, and guarantees accountability across agent interactions. Furthermore, we propose a Defense Orchestration Engine (DOE) that actively neutralizes attacks through real-time mechanisms, including Byzantine agent flagging, reactive execution halting, and instant permission revocation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate BlockA2A's effectiveness in neutralizing prompt-based, communication-based, behavioral and systemic MAS attacks. We formalize its integration into existing MAS and showcase a practical implementation for Google's A2A protocol. Experiments confirm that BlockA2A and DOE operate with sub-second overhead, enabling scalable deployment in production LLM-based MAS environments.",

Docker-sec and LiCShield can be used to enhance Docker container security based on mandatory access control and allows protection of the container without manually configurations. Lic-Sec brings together their strengths and provides stronger protection. We evaluate the effectiveness and performance of Docker-sec and Lic-Sec by testing them with real-world attacks. We generate an exploit database with 42 exploits effective on Docker containers selected from the latest 400 exploits on Exploit-db. We launch these exploits on containers spawned with Docker-sec and Lic-Sec separately. Our evaluations show that for demanding images, Lic-Sec gives protection for all privilege escalation attacks for which Docker-sec failed to give protection.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces the Adaptive Defense Agent (ADA), an innovative Automated Moving Target Defense (AMTD) system designed to fundamentally enhance the security posture of AI workloads. ADA operates by continuously and automatically rotating these workloads at the infrastructure level, leveraging the inherent ephemerality of Kubernetes pods. This constant managed churn systematically invalidates attacker assumptions and disrupts potential kill chains by regularly destroying and respawning AI service instances. This methodology, applying principles of chaos engineering as a continuous, proactive defense, offers a paradigm shift from traditional static defenses that rely on complex and expensive confidential or trusted computing solutions to secure the underlying compute platforms, while at the same time agnostically supporting the latest advancements in agentic and nonagentic AI ecosystems and solutions such as agent-to-agent (A2A) communication frameworks or model context protocols (MCP). This AI-native infrastructure design, relying on the widely proliferated cloud-native Kubernetes technologies, facilitates easier deployment, simplifies maintenance through an inherent zero trust posture achieved by rotation, and promotes faster adoption. We posit that ADA's novel approach to AMTD provides a more robust, agile, and operationally efficient zero-trust model for AI services, achieving security through proactive environmental manipulation rather than reactive patching.",

      "abstract": "The increasing capabilities of LLMs have led to the rapid proliferation of LLM agent apps, where developers enhance LLMs with access to external resources to support complex task execution. Among these, LLM email agent apps represent one of the widely used categories, as email remains a critical communication medium for users. LLM email agents are capable of managing and responding to email using LLM-driven reasoning and autonomously executing user instructions via external email APIs (e.g., send email). However, despite their growing deployment and utility, the security mechanism of LLM email agent apps remains underexplored. Currently, there is no comprehensive study into the potential security risk within these agent apps and their broader implications.   In this paper, we conduct the first in-depth and systematic security study of LLM email agents. We propose the Email Agent Hijacking (EAH) attack, which overrides the original prompts of the email agent via external email resources, allowing attackers to gain control of the email agent remotely and further perform specific attack scenarios without user awareness.   To facilitate the large-scale evaluation, we propose EAHawk, a pipeline to evaluate the EAH attack of LLM email agent apps. By EAHawk, we performed an empirical study spanning 14 representative LLM agent frameworks, 63 agent apps, 12 LLMs, and 20 email services, which led to the generation of 1,404 real-world email agent instances for evaluation. Experimental results indicate that all 1,404 instances were successfully hijacked; on average, only 2.03 attack attempts are required to control an email agent instance. Even worse, for some LLMs, the average number of attempts needed to achieve full agent control drops to as few as 1.23.",

Time-Sensitive Applications (TSAs) have special requirements for compute and network. Deploying TSAs in Kubernetes is challenging because the networking implemented by Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins is not aware of the traffic characteristic required by Time-Sensitive Network. Even if a network interface supports TSN features (e.g.: Scheduled Traffic) and a modified CNI plugin is aware of this interface, the pod network isolation built on top of Linux deletes the metadata required for TSN protocols to work with.   We propose TSN metadata proxy, a simple architecture that allows any TSA microservice to use the TSN capabilities of the physical NIC, without any modification. This architecture is tightly integrated with the Kubernetes networking model, works with popular CNI plugins, and supports services such as ClusterIP, NodePort, or LoadBalancer without additional configuration. Unlike former proposals, this architecture does not require either bypassing the Linux kernel network stack, direct access to the physical NIC, escalated privileges for the TSA microservice, or even modification of the TSA.",

      "abstract": "The expansive globalization of the semiconductor supply chain has introduced numerous untrusted entities into different stages of a device's lifecycle. To make matters worse, the increase complexity in the design as well as aggressive time to market requirements of the newer generation of integrated circuits can lead either designers to unintentionally introduce security vulnerabilities or verification engineers to fail in detecting them earlier in the design lifecycle. These overlooked or undetected vulnerabilities can be exploited by malicious entities in subsequent stages of the lifecycle through an ever widening variety of hardware attacks. The ability to ascertain the provenance of these vulnerabilities, therefore, becomes a pressing issue when the security assurance across the whole lifecycle is required to be ensured. We posit that if there is a malicious or unintentional breach of security policies of a device, it will be reflected in the form of anomalies in the traditional design, verification and testing activities throughout the lifecycle. With that, a digital simulacrum of a device's lifecycle, called a digital twin (DT), can be formed by the data gathered from different stages to secure the lifecycle of the device. In this paper, we put forward a realization of intertwined relationships of security vulnerabilities with data available from the silicon lifecycle and formulate different components of an AI driven DT framework. The proposed DT framework leverages these relationships and relational learning to achieve Forward and Backward Trust Analysis functionalities enabling security aware management of the entire lifecycle. Finally, we provide potential future research avenues and challenges for realization of the digital twin framework to enable secure semiconductor lifecycle management.",

This review presents a structured analysis of \\textbf{Trust, Risk, and Security Management (TRiSM)} in the context of LLM-based Agentic Multi-Agent Systems (AMAS). We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around four key pillars: Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy and Governance, each contextualized to the challenges of multi-agent LLM systems. A novel risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI , as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, outlining critical directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles for safe, transparent, and accountable operation.",

      "abstract": "This study investigates the potential of WebAssembly as a more secure and efficient alternative to Linux containers for executing untrusted code in cloud computing with Kubernetes. Specifically, it evaluates the security and performance implications of this shift. Security analyses demonstrate that both Linux containers and WebAssembly have attack surfaces when executing untrusted code, but WebAssembly presents a reduced attack surface due to an additional layer of isolation. The performance analysis further reveals that while WebAssembly introduces overhead, particularly in startup times, it could be negligible in long-running computations. However, WebAssembly enhances the core principle of containerization, offering better security through isolation and platform-agnostic portability compared to Linux containers. This research demonstrates that WebAssembly is not a silver bullet for all security concerns or performance requirements in a Kubernetes environment, but typical attacks are less likely to succeed and the performance loss is relatively small.",

In this survey, we introduce the first unified, end-to-end threat model for LLM-agent ecosystems, spanning host-to-tool and agent-to-agent communications, formalize adversary capabilities and attacker objectives, and catalog over thirty attack techniques. Specifically, we organized the threat model into four domains: Input Manipulation (e.g., prompt injections, long-context hijacks, multimodal adversarial inputs), Model Compromise (e.g., prompt- and parameter-level backdoors, composite and encrypted multi-backdoors, poisoning strategies), System and Privacy Attacks (e.g., speculative side-channels, membership inference, retrieval poisoning, social-engineering simulations), and Protocol Vulnerabilities (e.g., exploits in Model Context Protocol (MCP), Agent Communication Protocol (ACP), Agent Network Protocol (ANP), and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol). For each category, we review representative scenarios, assess real-world feasibility, and evaluate existing defenses. Building on our threat taxonomy, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, such as securing MCP deployments through dynamic trust management and cryptographic provenance tracking; designing and hardening Agentic Web Interfaces; and achieving resilience in multi-agent and federated environments.

      "abstract": "Cloud computing has emerged as a corner stone of today's computing landscape. More and more customers who outsource their infrastructure benefit from the manageability, scalability and cost saving that come with cloud computing. Those benefits get amplified by the trend towards microservices. Instead of renting and maintaining full VMs, customers increasingly leverage container technologies, which come with a much more lightweight resource footprint while also removing the need to emulate complete systems and their devices.   However, privacy concerns hamper many customers from moving to the cloud and leveraging its benefits. Furthermore, regulatory requirements prevent the adaption of cloud computing in many industries, such as health care or finance. Standard software isolation mechanisms have been proven to be insufficient if the host system is not fully trusted, e.g., when the cloud infrastructure gets compromised by malicious third-party actors. Consequently, confidential computing is gaining increasing relevance in the cloud computing field.   We present Trusted Container Extensions (TCX), a novel container security architecture, which combines the manageability and agility of standard containers with the strong protection guarantees of hardware-enforced Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to enable confidential computing for container workloads. TCX provides significant performance advantages compared to existing approaches while protecting container workloads and the data processed by them. Our implementation, based on AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV), ensures integrity and confidentiality of data and services during deployment, and allows secure interaction between protected containers as well as to external entities.

      "abstract": "As Agentic AI systems evolve from basic workflows to complex multi agent collaboration, robust protocols such as Google's Agent2Agent (A2A) become essential enablers. To foster secure adoption and ensure the reliability of these complex interactions, understanding the secure implementation of A2A is essential. This paper addresses this goal by providing a comprehensive security analysis centered on the A2A protocol. We examine its fundamental elements and operational dynamics, situating it within the framework of agent communication development. Utilizing the MAESTRO framework, specifically designed for AI risks, we apply proactive threat modeling to assess potential security issues in A2A deployments, focusing on aspects such as Agent Card management, task execution integrity, and authentication methodologies.   Based on these insights, we recommend practical secure development methodologies and architectural best practices designed to build resilient and effective A2A systems. Our analysis also explores how the synergy between A2A and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) can further enhance secure interoperability. This paper equips developers and architects with the knowledge and practical guidance needed to confidently leverage the A2A protocol for building robust and secure next generation agentic applications.",

      "abstract": "Micro service architecture has revolutionized the landscape for the development of web and mobile applications alike. Due to the stateless nature and loose coupling involved in the design of micro services, native mobile applications can be developed by utilizing the same backend services which feed the inputs to the web application front ends. Extending the same concept, a plethora of automated devices, thanks to the advancements in the field of IOT, have come into existence which can feed on the same set of micro services. This concept of build once and utilize for many use cases has become a new norm in the enterprise design patterns. To handle the horizontal scalability needs of so many calling clients, significant advancements have been made on the containerization and their orchestration strategies on the public cloud platforms. However, scalable design techniques have led to the increased exposure of backend services to unwanted entities. This broadened the attack surface and also the risk. On top of it the mix of heterogeneous technologies in MSA, their distinct logging strategies, makes the central logging difficult, which in turn loosens the security. Additionally, the complexity around building the resilience for fault tolerance across the decentralized networks, adds to the security loop holes. The simple security designs which were once used with traditional web applications cannot be used for Microservice based applications. This paper articulates the innovative approaches of handling the security needs involved in protection of distributed services in Microservice architecture.",
