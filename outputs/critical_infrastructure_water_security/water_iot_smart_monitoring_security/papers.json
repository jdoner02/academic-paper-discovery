      "abstract": "The integration of security and energy efficiency in Internet of Things systems remains a critical challenge, particularly for battery-free and resource-constrained devices. This paper explores the scalability and protocol-agnostic nature of a backscattering-based security mechanism by integrating it into Bluetooth Low Energy battery-free Wireless Sensor Network. The proposed approach leverages the Wireless Power Transfer link, traditionally used for energy harvesting, to generate additional identification signals without increasing energy consumption or computational demands. Experimental validation demonstrates the solution's functionality using compact, low-gain antenna, ensuring compatibility with size-constrained applications such as Structural Health Monitoring and smart transport. Furthermore, this work addresses the challenges associated with backscattering dynamic range and multi-node Wireless Sensor Network scenarios, discussing potential collisions between identification signals and proposing future improvements to enhance generalizability and scalability. The findings underscore the potential of the backscattering-based security mechanism for creating secure, sustainable, and scalable IoT deployments across diverse protocols and applications.",

      "abstract": "Wearable Internet of Things (IoT) devices are gaining ground for continuous physiological data acquisition and health monitoring. These physiological signals can be used for security applications to achieve continuous authentication and user convenience due to passive data acquisition. This paper investigates an electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric user authentication system using features derived from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and self-supervised contrastive learning. Contrastive learning enables us to use large unlabeled datasets to train the model and establish its generalizability. We propose approaches enabling the CNN encoder to extract appropriate features that distinguish the user from other subjects. When evaluated using the PTB ECG database with 290 subjects, the proposed technique achieved an authentication accuracy of 99.15%. To test its generalizability, we applied the model to two new datasets, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the ECG-ID Database, achieving over 98.5% accuracy without any modifications. Furthermore, we show that repeating the authentication step three times can increase accuracy to nearly 100% for both PTBDB and ECGIDDB. This paper also presents model optimizations for embedded device deployment, which makes the system more relevant to real-world scenarios. To deploy our model in IoT edge sensors, we optimized the model complexity by applying quantization and pruning. The optimized model achieves 98.67% accuracy on PTBDB, with 0.48% accuracy loss and 62.6% CPU cycles compared to the unoptimized model. An accuracy-vs-time-complexity tradeoff analysis is performed, and results are presented for different optimization levels.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of billions of interconnected, primarily low-end embedded devices. Despite large-scale deployment, studies have highlighted critical security concerns in IoT networks, many of which stem from firmware-related issues. Furthermore, IoT swarms have become more prevalent in industries, smart homes, and agricultural applications, among others. Malicious activity on one node in a swarm can propagate to larger network sections. Although several Remote Attestation (RA) techniques have been proposed, they are limited by their latency, availability, complexity, hardware assumptions, and uncertain access to firmware copies under Intellectual Property (IP) rights. We present Swarm-Net, a novel swarm attestation technique that exploits the inherent, interconnected, graph-like structure of IoT networks along with the runtime information stored in the Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to detect malicious firmware and its downstream effects. We also present the first datasets on SRAM-based swarm attestation encompassing different types of firmware and edge relationships. In addition, a secure swarm attestation protocol is presented. Swarm-Net is not only computationally lightweight but also does not require a copy of the firmware. It achieves a 99.96% attestation rate on authentic firmware, 100% detection rate on anomalous firmware, and 99% detection rate on propagated anomalies, at a communication overhead and inference latency of ~1 second and ~10^{-5} seconds (on a laptop CPU), respectively. In addition to the collected datasets, Swarm-Net's effectiveness is evaluated on simulated trace replay, random trace perturbation, and dropped attestation responses, showing robustness against such threats. Lastly, we compare Swarm-Net with past works and present a security analysis.",

      "abstract": "Secure and efficient multi-user access mechanisms are increasingly important for the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being used today.   Kerberos is a well-known and time-tried security authentication and access control system for distributed systems wherein many users securely access various distributed services. Traditionally, these services are software applications or devices, such as printers. However, Kerberos is not directly suitable for IoT devices due to its relatively heavy-weight protocols and the resource-constrained nature of the devices.   This paper presents KESIC, a system that enables efficient and secure multi-user access for IoT devices. KESIC aims to facilitate mutual authentication of IoT devices and users via Kerberos without modifying the latter's protocols. To facilitate that, KESIC includes a special Kerberized service, called IoT Server, that manages access to IoT devices. KESIC presents two protocols for secure and comprehensive multi-user access system for two types of IoT devices: general and severely power constrained. In terms of performance, KESIC onsumes $\\approx~47$ times less memory, and incurs $\\approx~135$ times lower run-time overhead than Kerberos.",

      "abstract": "The short message service (SMS) is a service for exchanging texts via mobile networks that has been developed not only as a means of text communication between subscribers but also as a means to remotely manage Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the originating number of an SMS can be spoofed. If IoT devices authenticate administrators based on the originating number of an SMS, the authentication is bypassed via SMS origin spoofing. Consequently, IoT devices are at risk of accepting commands from attackers and performing unauthorized actions. Accordingly, in this study, the specifications of major cellular IoT gateways were evaluated by focusing on remote management via SMS, and the authentication bypass hypothesis was verified. The results showed that 25 of the 32 targeted products supported SMS-based remote management, and 20 implemented authentication based on the originating number of the SMS. Furthermore, by spoofing the originating number of the SMS, one product was demonstrated to be remotely exploitable through authentication bypassing. Thus, this study revealed the threats posed by SMS origin spoofing to IoT devices and proved that SMS origin spoofing not only threatens text communication between people but also puts machine communication at risk.",

The medical professionals (doctors, nurses, or medical experts) can access vitals and sensitive physiological information about the patients and provide proper treatment to improve the quality of life through the RPM network. However, the wireless nature of communication in the RPM network makes it challenging to design an efficient mechanism for secure communication. Many authentication schemes have been proposed in recent years to ensure the security of the RPM network. Pseudonym, digital signature, and Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols are used for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to develop secure authorization and privacy-preserving communication. However, traditional authentication protocols face overhead challenges due to maintaining a large set of key-pairs or pseudonyms results on the hospital cloud server. In this research work, we identify this research gap and propose a novel secure and efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme using cuckoo filters for the RPM network. The use of cuckoo filters in our proposed scheme provides an efficient way for mutual anonymous authentication and a secret shared key establishment process between medical professionals and patients. Moreover, we identify the misbehaving sensor nodes using a correlation-based anomaly detection model to establish secure communication. The security analysis and formal security validation using SPAN and AVISPA tools show the robustness of our proposed scheme against message modification attacks, replay attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.",

Data from the broadcast messages (i.e. beacon frame characteristics) are utilized to implement the authentication factor that confirms proximity between two devices in an ad hoc IoT network.",

These networks, which have many uses and are subject to limitations, the most important of which is the energy constraint, this energy constraint creates the requirement that the number And the length of the messages exchanged between the sensors is low. Sensor networks do not have a stable topology due to their inaccessible environments, and continually changes with the disappearance or addition of a node, support for the topology is performed in three steps before deployment, after deployment and deployment. . The sensor nodes are scattered across the field and transmitted by a multidimensional connection to the sink. The communication protocol of the sensor networks used by all nodes in the network and sink. The protocol consists of five layers and three levels of management. Sensor networks require a kind of security mechanism due to inaccessibility and protection. Conventional security mechanisms are inefficient due to the inherent limitations of sensor nodes in these networks. Sensor nodes, due to energy and resource constraints, require security requirements such as the confidentiality of data integrity data, authentication, synchronization, etc. Currently, many organizations use wireless sensor networks for purposes such as air, Pollution, Traffic Control and Healthcare Security is the main concern of wireless sensor networks. In this article, I will focus on the types of security attacks and their detection. This article outlines security needs and security attacks in wireless sensor networks.

In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving protocol for collecting aggregated data from WSNs. The protocol relies on the Onion Routing technique to provide uniformly distributed network traffic and confine the knowledge a foreign actor can gain from monitoring messages traveling the network. Our solution employs the computing power of nodes in the network by conveying them general-purpose computer code for in-situ processing and aggregation of data sourcing from multiple sensor nodes.

The update process of these IoT devices usually lack the ability of checking the security of centralized servers, which may be compromised and host malicious firmware files as it is presumed that the servers are secure during deployment. The solution for this problem can be solved using a decentralized database to hold the hashes and the firmware. This paper discusses the possible implications of insecure servers used to host the firmwares of commercial IoT products, and aims to provide a blockchain based decentralized solution to host firmware files with the property of immutability, and controlled access to the firmware upload functions so as to stop unauthorized use.

While most technology stacks provide means for authentication and encryption of device-to-cloud traffic, there are currently no mechanisms to rule out physical tampering with an IoT device's sensors. Addressing this gap, we introduce a new method for extracting a hardware fingerprint of an IoT sensor which can be used for secret-free authentication. By comparing the fingerprint against reference measurements recorded prior to deployment, we can tell whether the sensing hardware connected to the IoT device has been changed by environmental effects or with malicious intent. Our approach exploits the characteristic behavior of analog circuits, which is revealed by applying a fixed-frequency alternating current to the sensor, while recording its output voltage. To demonstrate the general feasibility of our method, we apply it to four commercially available temperature sensors using laboratory equipment and evaluate the accuracy. The results indicate that with a sensible configuration of the two hyperparameters we can identify individual sensors with high probability, using only a few recordings from the target device.",

Existing approaches to authenticate these devices limit themselves to dedicated sensors or specified user motions, undermining their widespread acceptance. This paper overcomes these limitations with a general authentication solution by integrating wireless physical layer (PHY) signatures with upper-layer protocols. The key enabling techniques are constructing representative radio propagation profiles from received signals, and developing an adversarial multi-player neural network to accurately recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. Once hearing a suspicious transmission, our system triggers a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to defend in depth against active attacks. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances and environment changes. We build a prototype of our system using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with various static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 91.6%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.96 and a better generalization performance compared with the conventional non-adversarial approach.",

      "abstract": "As the Internet of Things (IoT) emerges over the next decade, developing secure communication for IoT devices is of paramount importance. Achieving end-to-end encryption for large-scale IoT systems, like smart buildings or smart cities, is challenging because multiple principals typically interact indirectly via intermediaries, meaning that the recipient of a message is not known in advance. This paper proposes JEDI (Joining Encryption and Delegation for IoT), a many-to-many end-to-end encryption protocol for IoT. JEDI encrypts and signs messages end-to-end, while conforming to the decoupled communication model typical of IoT systems. JEDI's keys support expiry and fine-grained access to data, common in IoT. Furthermore, JEDI allows principals to delegate their keys, restricted in expiry or scope, to other principals, thereby granting access to data and managing access control in a scalable, distributed way. Through careful protocol design and implementation, JEDI can run across the spectrum of IoT devices, including ultra low-power deeply embedded sensors severely constrained in CPU, memory, and energy consumption. We apply JEDI to an existing IoT messaging system and demonstrate that its overhead is modest.",

Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management, render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of 86-99% and a mean accuracy of 99%, across all our experiments. Our approach is successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e., identifying different device types having similar functionality.",

      "abstract": "Data collection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) draws significant attention, due to emerging interest in technologies raging from Internet of Things (IoT) networks to simple \"Presence\" applications, which identify the status of the devices (active or inactive). Numerous Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for WSN, which can address the challenge of data collection in dense networks, were suggested over the years. Most of these protocols utilize the traditional layering approach, in which the MAC layer is unaware of the encapsulated packet payload, and therefore there is no connection between the data collected, the physical layer and the signaling mechanisms. Nonetheless, in many of the applications that intend to utilize such protocols, nodes may need to exchange very little information, and do so only sporadically, that is, while the number of devices in the network can be very large, only a subset wishes to transmit at any given time. Thus, a tailored protocol, which matches the signaling, physical layer and access control to traffic patterns is required.   In this work, we design and analyze a data collection protocol based on information theoretic principles. In the suggested protocol, the sink collects messages from up to K sensors simultaneously, out of a large population of sensors, without knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without requiring any synchronization, coordination or management overhead. In other words, neither the sink nor the other sensors need to know who are the actively transmitting sensors, and this data is decoded directly from the channel output. We provide a simple codebook construction with very simple encoding and decoding procedures. We further design a secure version of the protocol.",

However, reducing size of IoT nodes and lack of significant improvement in energy-storage density leads to reducing energy-availability. Moreover, smaller size and energy means less resources available for securing IoT nodes, making the energy-sparse low-cost leaf nodes of the network as prime targets for attackers.

We proposed a security model that consists of the server and mobile devices in order to realize these security features. In this model we defined the secure communication protocol for the authentication and management of data encryption keys using a private key encryption algorithm with the public key between the server and mobile devices. In addition, we was performed the analysis for the attack to the communication protocol between the mobile device and server. Using the communication protocol, the system will attempt to authenticate the mobile device. The data decrypt key is transmitted only if the authentication process is successful.

      "abstract": "Security of wireless sensor network (WSN) is always considered a critical issue and has a number of considerations that separate them from traditional wireless sensor network. First, sensor devices are typically vulnerable to physical compromise. Second, they have significant power and processing constraints. Third, the most critical security issue is protecting the aggregate output of the system, even if individual nodes may be compromised. While a variety of security techniques are being developed and lots of researches are going on security fields. In this paper we have proposed a new technique to provide data authentication and privacy in faster, scalable and cost effective way.",

      "abstract": "Security concern for a Sensor Networks and level of security desired may differ according to application specific needs where the sensor networks are deployed. Till now, most of the security solutions proposed for sensor networks are layer wise i.e a particular solution is applicable to single layer itself. So, to integrate them all is a new research challenge. In this paper we took up the challenge and have proposed an integrated comprehensive security framework that will provide security services for all services of sensor network. We have added one extra component i.e. Intelligent Security Agent (ISA) to assess level of security and cross layer interactions. This framework has many components like Intrusion Detection System, Trust Framework, Key Management scheme and Link layer communication protocol. We have also tested it on three different application scenarios in Castalia and Omnet++ simulator.",
