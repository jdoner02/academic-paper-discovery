      "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Fog computing, mobile edge computing and wireless grids has resulted in the widespread deployment of relatively immature technology. These technologies, which will primarily use 5G wireless communication networks, are becoming popular because they can be deployed quickly with little infrastructure and lends themselves to environments utilizing numerous internet connected devices (ICD). Because of the threat of exploitation, these networks have to be protected by a robust security architecture due to these technologies being plagued with security problems. The authentication of smart ICDs to IoT networks is a critical mechanism for achieving security on these new information system platforms. This article identifies an authentication process required for these ICDs, which will need to prove their identity to authenticate to an IoT fog-mobile edge computing (FMEC) cloud network through a wireless grid authentication process. The purpose of this article is to hypothesize a generic authentication methodology for these FMEC clouds uses in an IoT architecture. The proposed methodology, called wg-IoT, must include the integration of Fog computing, wireless grids and mobile edge computing clouds to create this new IoT architecture. An authentication process developed from the resource sharing protocol (RSP) from a wireless grid is first developed and proposed for the authentication of ICDs. The wireless grid core components must be embedded in IoT devices or sensors depending on their capability to handle five primary functions: management of identification [ID] and presence, permissions management, data transferability, application-programming interface [API] and security.",

      "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) drastically increases the number of connected devices in homes, workplaces and smart city infrastructures. This drives a need for means to not only ensure confidentiality of device-related communications, but for device configuration and management---ensuring that only legitimate devices are granted privileges to a local domain, that only authorized agents have access to the device and data it holds, and that software updates are authentic. The need to support device on-boarding, ongoing device management and control, and secure decommissioning dictates a suite of key management services for both access control to devices, and access by devices to wireless infrastructure and networked resources. We identify this core functionality, and argue for the recognition of efficient and reliable key management support---both within IoT devices, and by a unifying external management platform---as a baseline requirement for an IoT world. We present a framework architecture to facilitate secure, flexible and convenient device management in commodity IoT scenarios, and offer an illustrative set of protocols as a base solution---not to promote specific solution details, but to highlight baseline functionality to help domain owners oversee deployments of large numbers of independent multi-vendor IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "Smart cities deploy large numbers of sensors and collect a tremendous amount of data from them. For example, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which consist of physical meters that collect usage data about public utilities such as power and water, are an important building block in a smart city. In a typical sensor network, the measurement devices are connected through a computer network, which exposes them to cyber attacks. Furthermore, the data is centrally managed at the operator's servers, making it vulnerable to insider threats.   Our goal is to protect the integrity of data collected by large-scale sensor networks and the firmware in measurement devices from cyber attacks and insider threats. To this end, we first develop a comprehensive threat model for attacks against data and firmware integrity, which can target any of the stakeholders in the operation of the sensor network. Next, we use our threat model to analyze existing defense mechanisms, including signature checks, remote firmware attestation, anomaly detection, and blockchain-based secure logs. However, the large size of the Trusted Computing Base and a lack of scalability limit the applicability of these existing mechanisms. We propose the Feather-Light Blockchain Infrastructure (FLBI) framework to address these limitations. Our framework leverages a two-layer architecture and cryptographic threshold signature chains to support large networks of low-capacity devices such as meters and data aggregators. We have fully implemented the FLBI's end-to-end functionality on the Hyperledger Fabric and private Ethereum blockchain platforms. Our experiments show that the FLBI is able to support millions of end devices.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a futuristic technology that promises to connect tons of devices via the internet. As more individuals connect to the internet, it is believed that communication will generate mountains of data. IoT is currently leveraging Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) to collect, monitor, and transmit data and sensitive data across wireless networks using sensor nodes. WSNs encounter a variety of threats posed by attackers, including unauthorized access and data security. Especially in the context of the Internet of Things, where small embedded devices with limited computational capabilities, such as sensor nodes, are expected to connect to a larger network. As a result, WSNs are vulnerable to a variety of attacks. Furthermore, implementing security is time-consuming and selective, as traditional security algorithms degrade network performance due to their computational complexity and inherent delays. This paper describes an encryption algorithm that combines the Secure IoT (SIT) algorithm with the Security Protocols for Sensor Networks (SPINS) security protocol to create the Lightweight Security Algorithm (LSA), which addresses data security concerns while reducing power consumption in WSNs without sacrificing performance.",

Traditional Physical Layer Security (PLS)-based cryptography approaches rely on accurate channel estimation and information exchange for key generation, which irrevocably ties key quality with digital channel estimation quality. Recently, we proposed a new concept called Graph Layer Security (GLS), where digital keys are derived from physical sensor readings. The sensor readings between legitimate users are correlated through a common background infrastructure environment (e.g., a common water distribution network or electric grid). The challenge for GLS has been how to achieve distributed key generation. This paper presents a Federated multi-agent Deep reinforcement learning-assisted Distributed Key generation scheme (FD2K), which fully exploits the common features of physical dynamics to establish secret key between legitimate users. We present for the first time initial experimental results of GLS with federated learning, achieving considerable security performance in terms of key agreement rate (KAR), and key randomness.",

A set of these devices can be integrated into a Wireless Biomedical Sensor Network (WBSN), a new breakthrough technology used in telemedicine for monitoring the physiological condition of an individual. The biosensor nodes in WBSN has got resource limitations in terms of battery lifetime, CPU processing capability, and memory capacity. Replacement or recharging of batteries on thousands of biosensor nodes is quiet difficult or too costly. So, a key challenge in wireless biomedical sensor networks is the reduction of energy and memory consumption. Considering, the sensitivity of information in WBSN, we must provide security and patient privacy, as it is an important issue in the design of such systems. Hence this paper proposes an energy efficient security protocol for WBSN where security is provided to the physiological data, which is being transmitted from the sensor node to the sink device. This is achieved by authenticating the data using patients biometric, encrypting the data using Quasi Group cryptography after compressing the image data using an energy efficient number theory based technique.",

Firmware security is addressed through mechanisms like cryptographic integrity validation and secure boot processes.

      "abstract": "Wireless device pairing is a critical security mechanism to bootstrap the secure communication between two devices without a pre-shared secret. It has been widely used in many Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as smart-home and smart-health. Most existing device pairing mechanisms are based on out-of-band channels, e.g., extra sensors or hardware, to validate the proximity of pairing devices. However, out-of-band channels are not universal across all wireless devices, so such a scheme is limited to certain application scenarios or conditions. On the other hand, in-band channel-based device pairing seeks universal applicability by only relying on wireless interfaces. Existing in-band channel-based pairing schemes either require multiple antennas separated by a good distance on one pairing device, which is not feasible in certain scenarios, or require users to repeat multiple sweeps, which is not optimal in terms of usability.   Therefore, an in-band wireless device pairing scheme providing high security while maintaining high usability (simple pairing process and minimal user intervention) is highly desired. In this work, we propose an easy-to-use mutual authentication device pairing scheme, named Swipe2Pair, based on the proximity of pairing devices and randomization of wireless transmission power. We conduct extensive security analysis and collect considerable experimental data under various settings across different environments. Experimental results show that Swipe2Pair achieves high security and usability. It only takes less than one second to complete the pairing process with a simple swipe of one device in front of the other.",

      "abstract": "Authentication is one of the essential security services in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for ensuring secure data sessions. Sensor node authentication ensures the confidentiality and validity of data collected by the sensor node, whereas user authentication guarantees that only legitimate users can access the sensor data. In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network and exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication process multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT) brings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security requirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish multiple concurrent secure data sessions. With concurrent data sessions, the frequency of the re-authentication process increases in proportion to the number of concurrent connections, which makes the security issue even more challenging. The currently available authentication protocols were designed for the autonomous WSN and do not account for the above requirements. In this paper, we present a novel, lightweight and efficient key exchange and authentication protocol suite called the Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN) Authentication Protocol. In the SMSN a mobile node goes through an initial authentication procedure and receives a re-authentication ticket from the base station. Later a mobile node can use this re-authentication ticket when establishing multiple data exchange sessions and/or when moving across the network. This scheme reduces the communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. We proved the strength of our protocol with rigorous security analysis and simulated the SMSN and previously proposed schemes in an automated protocol verifier tool. Finally, we compared the computational complexity and communication cost against well-known authentication protocols.",

Any IoT based Industry 4.0 enterprise designs networks between hundreds of tiny devices such as sensors, actuators, fog devices and gateways. Thus, articulating a secure authentication protocol between sensing devices or a sensing device and user devices is an essential step in IoT security. In this paper, first, we present cryptanalysis for the certificate-based scheme proposed for similar environment by Das et al. and prove that their scheme is vulnerable to various traditional attacks such as device anonymity, MITM, and DoS. We then put forward an inter-device authentication scheme using an ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) that is highly secure and lightweight compared to other schemes for a similar environment. Furthermore, we set forth a formal security analysis using the random oracle based ROR model and informal security analysis over the Doleve-Yao channel. In this paper, we present the comparison of the proposed scheme with existing schemes based on communication cost, computation cost and security index to prove that the proposed EBAKE-SE is highly efficient, reliable, and trustworthy compared to other existing schemes for inter-device authentication.

      "abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly being adopted into practical applications such as security systems, smart infrastructure, traffic management, weather systems, among others. While the scale of these applications is enormous, device capabilities, particularly in terms of battery life and energy efficiency are limited. Despite research being done to ameliorate these shortcomings, wireless IoT networks still cannot guarantee satisfactory network lifetimes and prolonged sensing coverage. Moreover, proposed schemes in literature are convoluted and cannot be easily implemented in real-world scenarios. This necessitates the development of a simple yet energy efficient routing scheme for wireless IoT sensor networks. This paper models the energy constraint problem of devices in IoT applications as an optimization problem. To conserve the energy of device nodes, the routing protocol first aggregates devices into clusters based on a number of different features such as distance from base station, data/message length and data sensed from the environment in the current epoch. Then, a cluster head is elected for each cluster and a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is generated with all the cluster heads as nodes. Edges represent communication intent from transmitter to receiver and the edge weights are computed using a formulated equation. The minimum cost path to the base station is computed to allow for efficient real-time routing. Sleep scheduling is also optionally used to further boost network energy efficiency. The proposed routing protocol has been simulated and outperforms existing routing protocols in terms of metrics such as number of active nodes, energy dynamics and network coverage.",

Authentication is one of the essential security services to support the stored data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This research focuses on the secure storage of patient and medical records in the healthcare sector where data security and unauthorized access is an ongoing issue. A potential solution comes from biometrics, although their use may be time-consuming and can slow down data retrieval. This research aims to overcome these challenges and enhance data access control in the healthcare sector through the addition of biometrics in the form of fingerprints. The proposed model for application in the healthcare sector consists of Collection, Network communication, and Authentication (CNA) using biometrics, which replaces an existing password-based access control method. A sensor then collects data and by using a network (wireless or Zig-bee), a connection is established, after connectivity analytics and data management work which processes and aggregate the data. Subsequently, access is granted to authenticated users of the application. This IoT-based biometric authentication system facilitates effective recognition and ensures confidentiality, integrity, and reliability of patients, records and other sensitive data. The proposed solution provides reliable access to healthcare data and enables secure access through the process of user and device authentication. The proposed model has been developed for access control to data through the authentication of users in healthcare to reduce data manipulation or theft.",

      "abstract": "Secure and efficient multi-user access mechanisms are increasingly important for the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being used today.   Kerberos is a well-known and time-tried security authentication and access control system for distributed systems wherein many users securely access various distributed services. Traditionally, these services are software applications or devices, such as printers. However, Kerberos is not directly suitable for IoT devices due to its relatively heavy-weight protocols and the resource-constrained nature of the devices.   This paper presents KESIC, a system that enables efficient and secure multi-user access for IoT devices. KESIC aims to facilitate mutual authentication of IoT devices and users via Kerberos without modifying the latter's protocols. To facilitate that, KESIC includes a special Kerberized service, called IoT Server, that manages access to IoT devices. KESIC presents two protocols for secure and comprehensive multi-user access system for two types of IoT devices: general and severely power constrained. In terms of performance, KESIC onsumes $\\approx~47$ times less memory, and incurs $\\approx~135$ times lower run-time overhead than Kerberos.",

The ever-shrinking size of unit computation (Moore's Law) and continued improvements in efficient communication (Shannon's Law) is expected to harness the true potential of the IoT revolution and produce dramatic societal impact. However, reducing size of IoT nodes and lack of significant improvement in energy-storage density leads to reducing energy-availability. Moreover, smaller size and energy means less resources available for securing IoT nodes, making the energy-sparse low-cost leaf nodes of the network as prime targets for attackers.

In addition, we was performed the analysis for the attack to the communication protocol between the mobile device and server. Using the communication protocol, the system will attempt to authenticate the mobile device. The data decrypt key is transmitted only if the authentication process is successful.

Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management, render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of 86-99% and a mean accuracy of 99%, across all our experiments. Our approach is successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e., identifying different device types having similar functionality.",

      "abstract": "Data collection in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) draws significant attention, due to emerging interest in technologies raging from Internet of Things (IoT) networks to simple \"Presence\" applications, which identify the status of the devices (active or inactive). Numerous Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols for WSN, which can address the challenge of data collection in dense networks, were suggested over the years. Most of these protocols utilize the traditional layering approach, in which the MAC layer is unaware of the encapsulated packet payload, and therefore there is no connection between the data collected, the physical layer and the signaling mechanisms. Nonetheless, in many of the applications that intend to utilize such protocols, nodes may need to exchange very little information, and do so only sporadically, that is, while the number of devices in the network can be very large, only a subset wishes to transmit at any given time. Thus, a tailored protocol, which matches the signaling, physical layer and access control to traffic patterns is required.   In this work, we design and analyze a data collection protocol based on information theoretic principles. In the suggested protocol, the sink collects messages from up to K sensors simultaneously, out of a large population of sensors, without knowing in advance which sensors will transmit, and without requiring any synchronization, coordination or management overhead. In other words, neither the sink nor the other sensors need to know who are the actively transmitting sensors, and this data is decoded directly from the channel output. We provide a simple codebook construction with very simple encoding and decoding procedures. We further design a secure version of the protocol.",

These networks play a significant role in a broad range of fields, from crucial military surveillance applications to monitoring building security. Key management in WSNs is a critical task. While the security and integrity of messages communicated through these networks and the authenticity of the nodes are dependent on the robustness of the key management schemes, designing an efficient key generation, distribution, and revocation scheme is quite challenging. While resource-constrained sensor nodes should not be exposed to computationally demanding asymmetric key algorithms, the use of symmetric key-based systems leaves the entire network vulnerable to several attacks.

In this paper, we propose a privacy preserving protocol for collecting aggregated data from WSNs. The protocol relies on the Onion Routing technique to provide uniformly distributed network traffic and confine the knowledge a foreign actor can gain from monitoring messages traveling the network. Our solution employs the computing power of nodes in the network by conveying them general-purpose computer code for in-situ processing and aggregation of data sourcing from multiple sensor nodes.

These physiological signals can be used for security applications to achieve continuous authentication and user convenience due to passive data acquisition. This paper investigates an electrocardiogram (ECG) based biometric user authentication system using features derived from the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and self-supervised contrastive learning. Contrastive learning enables us to use large unlabeled datasets to train the model and establish its generalizability. We propose approaches enabling the CNN encoder to extract appropriate features that distinguish the user from other subjects. When evaluated using the PTB ECG database with 290 subjects, the proposed technique achieved an authentication accuracy of 99.15%. To test its generalizability, we applied the model to two new datasets, the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the ECG-ID Database, achieving over 98.5% accuracy without any modifications. Furthermore, we show that repeating the authentication step three times can increase accuracy to nearly 100% for both PTBDB and ECGIDDB. This paper also presents model optimizations for embedded device deployment, which makes the system more relevant to real-world scenarios. To deploy our model in IoT edge sensors, we optimized the model complexity by applying quantization and pruning. The optimized model achieves 98.67% accuracy on PTBDB, with 0.48% accuracy loss and 62.6% CPU cycles compared to the unoptimized model. An accuracy-vs-time-complexity tradeoff analysis is performed, and results are presented for different optimization levels.",

While most technology stacks provide means for authentication and encryption of device-to-cloud traffic, there are currently no mechanisms to rule out physical tampering with an IoT device's sensors. Addressing this gap, we introduce a new method for extracting a hardware fingerprint of an IoT sensor which can be used for secret-free authentication. By comparing the fingerprint against reference measurements recorded prior to deployment, we can tell whether the sensing hardware connected to the IoT device has been changed by environmental effects or with malicious intent. Our approach exploits the characteristic behavior of analog circuits, which is revealed by applying a fixed-frequency alternating current to the sensor, while recording its output voltage. To demonstrate the general feasibility of our method, we apply it to four commercially available temperature sensors using laboratory equipment and evaluate the accuracy. The results indicate that with a sensible configuration of the two hyperparameters we can identify individual sensors with high probability, using only a few recordings from the target device.",

Device Authentication and Key exchange are major challenges for the IoT. High computational resource requirements for cryptographic primitives and message transmission during Authentication make the existing methods like PKI and IBE not suitable for these resource constrained devices. PUF appears to offer a practical and economical security mechanism in place of typically sophisticated cryptosystems like PKI and IBE. PUF provides an unclonable and tamper sensitive unique signature based on the PUF chip by using manufacturing process variability. Therefore, in this study, we use lightweight bitwise XOR, hash function, and PUF to Authenticate IoT devices. Despite several studies employing the PUF to authenticate communication between IoT devices, to the authors' knowledge, existing solutions require intermediary gateway and internet capabilities by the IoT device to directly interact with a Server for Authentication and hence, are not scalable when the IoT device works on different technologies like BLE, Zigbee, etc. To address the aforementioned issue, we present a system in which the IoT device does not require a continuous active internet connection to communicate with the server in order to Authenticate itself. The results of a thorough security study are validated against adversarial attacks and PUF modeling attacks. For formal security validation, the AVISPA verification tool is also used. Performance study recommends this protocol's lightweight characteristics. The proposed protocol's acceptability and defenses against adversarial assaults are supported by a prototype developed with ESP32.",

Achieving end-to-end encryption for large-scale IoT systems, like smart buildings or smart cities, is challenging because multiple principals typically interact indirectly via intermediaries, meaning that the recipient of a message is not known in advance. This paper proposes JEDI (Joining Encryption and Delegation for IoT), a many-to-many end-to-end encryption protocol for IoT. JEDI encrypts and signs messages end-to-end, while conforming to the decoupled communication model typical of IoT systems. JEDI's keys support expiry and fine-grained access to data, common in IoT. Furthermore, JEDI allows principals to delegate their keys, restricted in expiry or scope, to other principals, thereby granting access to data and managing access control in a scalable, distributed way. Through careful protocol design and implementation, JEDI can run across the spectrum of IoT devices, including ultra low-power deeply embedded sensors severely constrained in CPU, memory, and energy consumption. We apply JEDI to an existing IoT messaging system and demonstrate that its overhead is modest.",

Traditional efforts to secure these devices against impersonation attacks mainly rely on either dedicated sensors or specified user motions, impeding their wide-scale adoption. This paper transcends these limitations with a general security solution by leveraging ubiquitous wireless chips available in IoT devices. Particularly, representative time and frequency features are first extracted from received signal strengths (RSSs) to characterize radio propagation profiles. Then, an adversarial multi-player network is developed to recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances. We build a prototype of our system using universal software radio peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with both static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 90.4%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.958 and better generalization performance in comparison with the conventional non-adversarial-based approach.",

The medical professionals (doctors, nurses, or medical experts) can access vitals and sensitive physiological information about the patients and provide proper treatment to improve the quality of life through the RPM network. However, the wireless nature of communication in the RPM network makes it challenging to design an efficient mechanism for secure communication. Many authentication schemes have been proposed in recent years to ensure the security of the RPM network. Pseudonym, digital signature, and Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocols are used for the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to develop secure authorization and privacy-preserving communication. However, traditional authentication protocols face overhead challenges due to maintaining a large set of key-pairs or pseudonyms results on the hospital cloud server. In this research work, we identify this research gap and propose a novel secure and efficient privacy-preserving authentication scheme using cuckoo filters for the RPM network. The use of cuckoo filters in our proposed scheme provides an efficient way for mutual anonymous authentication and a secret shared key establishment process between medical professionals and patients. Moreover, we identify the misbehaving sensor nodes using a correlation-based anomaly detection model to establish secure communication. The security analysis and formal security validation using SPAN and AVISPA tools show the robustness of our proposed scheme against message modification attacks, replay attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.",

However, the originating number of an SMS can be spoofed. If IoT devices authenticate administrators based on the originating number of an SMS, the authentication is bypassed via SMS origin spoofing. Consequently, IoT devices are at risk of accepting commands from attackers and performing unauthorized actions. Accordingly, in this study, the specifications of major cellular IoT gateways were evaluated by focusing on remote management via SMS, and the authentication bypass hypothesis was verified. The results showed that 25 of the 32 targeted products supported SMS-based remote management, and 20 implemented authentication based on the originating number of the SMS. Furthermore, by spoofing the originating number of the SMS, one product was demonstrated to be remotely exploitable through authentication bypassing. Thus, this study revealed the threats posed by SMS origin spoofing to IoT devices and proved that SMS origin spoofing not only threatens text communication between people but also puts machine communication at risk.",

      "abstract": "By adding users as a new dimension to connectivity, on-body Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices have gained considerable momentum in recent years, while raising serious privacy and safety issues. Existing approaches to authenticate these devices limit themselves to dedicated sensors or specified user motions, undermining their widespread acceptance. This paper overcomes these limitations with a general authentication solution by integrating wireless physical layer (PHY) signatures with upper-layer protocols. The key enabling techniques are constructing representative radio propagation profiles from received signals, and developing an adversarial multi-player neural network to accurately recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. Once hearing a suspicious transmission, our system triggers a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to defend in depth against active attacks. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances and environment changes. We build a prototype of our system using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with various static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 91.6%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.96 and a better generalization performance compared with the conventional non-adversarial approach.",

      "abstract": "Security concern for a Sensor Networks and level of security desired may differ according to application specific needs where the sensor networks are deployed. Till now, most of the security solutions proposed for sensor networks are layer wise i.e a particular solution is applicable to single layer itself. So, to integrate them all is a new research challenge. In this paper we took up the challenge and have proposed an integrated comprehensive security framework that will provide security services for all services of sensor network. We have added one extra component i.e. Intelligent Security Agent (ISA) to assess level of security and cross layer interactions. This framework has many components like Intrusion Detection System, Trust Framework, Key Management scheme and Link layer communication protocol. We have also tested it on three different application scenarios in Castalia and Omnet++ simulator.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of billions of interconnected, primarily low-end embedded devices. Despite large-scale deployment, studies have highlighted critical security concerns in IoT networks, many of which stem from firmware-related issues. Furthermore, IoT swarms have become more prevalent in industries, smart homes, and agricultural applications, among others. Malicious activity on one node in a swarm can propagate to larger network sections. Although several Remote Attestation (RA) techniques have been proposed, they are limited by their latency, availability, complexity, hardware assumptions, and uncertain access to firmware copies under Intellectual Property (IP) rights. We present Swarm-Net, a novel swarm attestation technique that exploits the inherent, interconnected, graph-like structure of IoT networks along with the runtime information stored in the Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) using Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to detect malicious firmware and its downstream effects. We also present the first datasets on SRAM-based swarm attestation encompassing different types of firmware and edge relationships. In addition, a secure swarm attestation protocol is presented. Swarm-Net is not only computationally lightweight but also does not require a copy of the firmware. It achieves a 99.96% attestation rate on authentic firmware, 100% detection rate on anomalous firmware, and 99% detection rate on propagated anomalies, at a communication overhead and inference latency of ~1 second and ~10^{-5} seconds (on a laptop CPU), respectively. In addition to the collected datasets, Swarm-Net's effectiveness is evaluated on simulated trace replay, random trace perturbation, and dropped attestation responses, showing robustness against such threats. Lastly, we compare Swarm-Net with past works and present a security analysis.",
