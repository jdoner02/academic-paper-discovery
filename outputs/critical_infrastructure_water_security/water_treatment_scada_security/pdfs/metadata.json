      "abstract": "Network Control Systems (NAC) have been used in many industrial processes. They aim to reduce the human factor burden and efficiently handle the complex process and communication of those systems. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems are used in industrial, infrastructure and facility processes (e.g. manufacturing, fabrication, oil and water pipelines, building ventilation, etc.) Like other Internet of Things (IoT) implementations, SCADA systems are vulnerable to cyber-attacks, therefore, a robust anomaly detection is a major requirement. However, having an accurate anomaly detection system is not an easy task, due to the difficulty to differentiate between cyber-attacks and system internal failures (e.g. hardware failures). In this paper, we present a model that detects anomaly events in a water system controlled by SCADA. Six Machine Learning techniques have been used in building and evaluating the model. The model classifies different anomaly events including hardware failures (e.g. sensor failures), sabotage and cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS and Spoofing). Unlike other detection systems, our proposed work focuses on notifying the operator when an anomaly occurs with a probability of the event occurring. This additional information helps in accelerating the mitigation process. The model is trained and tested using a real-world dataset.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1960s Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems have been used within industry. Referred to as critical infrastructure (CI), key installations such as power stations, water treatment and energy grids are controlled using SCADA. Existing literature reveals inherent security risks to CI and suggests this stems from the rise of interconnected networks, leading to the hypothesis that the rise of interconnectivity between corporate networks and SCADA system networks pose security risks to CI. The results from studies into previous global attacks involving SCADA and CI, with focus on two highly serious incidents in Iran and Ukraine, reveal that although interconnectivity is a major factor, isolated CIs are still highly vulnerable to attack due to risks within the SCADA controllers and protocols.",

      "abstract": "Distributed control systems (DCS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems were developed to reduce labour costs, and to allow system-wide monitoring and remote control from a central location. Control systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as electric grid, natural gas, water and wastewater industries. While control systems can be vulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating consequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems. American Gas Association (AGA), IEC TC57 WG15, IEEE, NIST and National SCADA Test Bed Program have been actively designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the report AGA 12 part 1. The AGA 12 part 2 has been transferred to IEEE P1711. This paper presents an attack on the protocols in the first draft of AGA standard (Wright et al., 2004). This attack shows that the security mechanisms in the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We then propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems which include: point-to-point secure channels, authenticated broadcast channels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency channels. These protocols are designed to address the specific challenges that SCADA systems have.",

Modern SCADA systems have evolved from standalone systems into sophisticated complex, open systems, connected to the Internet. This geographically distributed modern SCADA system is vulnerable to threats and cyber attacks. In this paper, we first review the SCADA system architectures that have been proposed/implemented followed by attacks on such systems to understand and highlight the evolving security needs for SCADA systems. A short investigation of the current state of intrusion detection techniques in SCADA systems is done , followed by a brief study of testbeds for SCADA systems. The cloud and Internet of things (IoT) based SCADA systems are studied by analysing the architecture of modern SCADA systems. This review paper ends by highlighting the critical research problems that need to be resolved to close the gaps in the security of SCADA systems.",

ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments.",

To solve this problem, we present a Virtual Cybersecurity Department (VCD), an affordable and automated framework designed for SMEs. The VCD uses open-source tools like Zabbix for real-time monitoring, Suricata for network intrusion detection, Fail2Ban to block repeated login attempts, and simple firewall settings. To improve threat detection, we also add a machine-learning-based IDS trained on the OD-IDS2022 dataset using an improved ensemble model. This model detects cyber threats such as brute-force attacks, remote code execution (RCE), and network flooding, with 92\\% accuracy and fewer false alarms. Our solution gives SMEs a practical and efficient way to secure water systems using low-cost and easy-to-manage tools.",

      "abstract": "The cyber-physical system of electricity power networks utilizes supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), which are inherently vulnerable to cyber threats if usually connected with the internet technology (IT). Power system operations are conducted through communication systems that are mapped to standards, protocols, ports, and addresses. Real-time situational awareness is a standard term with implications and applications in both power systems and cybersecurity. In the plausible quantum world (Q-world), conventional approaches will likely face new challenges. The unique art of transmitting a quantum state from one place, Alice, to another, Bob, is known as quantum communication. Quantum communication for SCADA communication in a plausible quantum era thus obviously entails wired communication through optical fiber networks complying with the typical cybersecurity criteria of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for classical internet technology unless a quantum internet (qinternet) transpires practically. When combined with the reverse order of AIC for operational technology, the cybersecurity criteria for power networks' critical infrastructure drill down to more specific sub-areas. Unlike other communication modes, such as information technology (IT) in broadband internet connections, SCADA for power networks, one of the critical infrastructures, is intricately intertwined with operations technology (OT), which significantly increases complexity. Though it is desirable to have a barrier called a demilitarized zone (DMZ), some overlap is inevitable. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges in securing SCADA communication in the plausible quantum computing and communication regime, along with a corresponding integrated Qiskit implementation for possible future framework development.",

It is acknowledged that Modbus TCP is usually vulnerable due to its unauthenticated and unencrypted nature. Our technique is evaluated using a simulation environment by configuring a testbed, which is a cus- tom SCADA network that is cheap, accurate and scalable. The testbed is exploited when testing the IDS by sending individual packets from an attacker located on the same LAN as the Modbus master and slave.

These attacks manipulate critical model parameters, injecting subtle distortions that degrade forecasting accuracy. To further exploit these vulnerabilities, we introduce a Learning Automata (LA) and Random LA-based approach that dynamically adjusts perturbations, making adversarial attacks more difficult to detect. Experimental results show that this approach significantly impacts prediction reliability, causing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to rise from 26% to over 35%. Moreover, adaptive attack strategies amplify this effect, highlighting cybersecurity risks in AI-driven DTs. These findings emphasize the urgent need for robust defenses, including adversarial training, anomaly detection, and secure data pipelines.",

Adversaries may exploit compromised SCADA protocols for the reconnaissance, data exfiltration, vulnerability assessment, and injection of stealthy cyberattacks to affect power system operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to generate robust rule sets. We integrate the rule sets into an intrusion detection system (IDS), which continuously monitors the DNP3 data traffic at a substation network and detects intrusions and anomalies in real-time. To enable CPS-aware wide-area situational awareness, we integrated the methodology into an open-source distributed-IDS (D-IDS) framework. The D-IDS facilitates central monitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed substations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different types of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are generated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules in different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules, and the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber Lab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models.

Protecting sensitive information is a difficult task to achieve in reality with the connection of physical and digital systems. Hence, privacy preservation techniques have become effective in order to protect sensitive/private information and to detect malicious activities, but they are not accurate in terms of error detection, sensitivity percentage of data disclosure. In this paper, we propose a new Privacy Preservation Intrusion Detection (PPID) technique based on the correlation coefficient and Expectation Maximisation (EM) clustering mechanisms for selecting important portions of data and recognizing intrusive events. This technique is evaluated on the power system datasets for multiclass attacks to measure its reliability for detecting suspicious activities.

      "abstract": "Due to the critical importance of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to the operations of cities and countries, research into the security of critical infrastructure has become increasingly relevant and necessary. As a component of both the research and application sides of smart city development, accurate and precise modeling, simulation, and verification are key parts of a robust design and development tools that provide critical assistance in the prevention, detection, and recovery from abnormal behavior in the sensors, controllers, and actuators which make up a modern ICS system. However, while these tools have potential, there is currently a need for helper-tools to assist with their setup and configuration, if they are to be utilized widely. Existing state-of-the-art tools are often technically complex and difficult to customize for any given IoT/ICS processes. This is a serious barrier to entry for most technicians, engineers, researchers, and smart city planners, while slowing down the critical aspects of safety and security verification. To remedy this issue, we take a case study of existing simulation toolkits within the field of water management and expand on existing tools and algorithms with simplistic automated retrieval functionality using a much more in-depth and usable customization interface to accelerate simulation scenario design and implementation, allowing for customization of the cyber-physical network infrastructure and cyber attack scenarios. We additionally provide a novel in-tool-assessment of network's resilience according to graph theory path diversity. Further, we lay out a roadmap for future development and application of the proposed tool, including expansions on resiliency and potential vulnerability model checking, and discuss applications of our work to other fields relevant to the design and operation of smart cities.",

This tool enables the launch of single and multi-point attacks where the latter are designed to specifically hide one or more attacks.

During the attacks, the network traffic was captured, and features were extracted from the traffic to build a dataset for training and testing different machine learning algorithms. Five traditional machine learning algorithms were trained to detect the attacks: Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes and KNN. Then, the trained machine learning models were built and deployed in the network, where new tests were made using online network traffic. The performance obtained during the training and testing of the machine learning models was compared to the performance obtained during the online deployment of these models in the network. The results show the efficiency of the machine learning models in detecting the attacks in real time.

Recently an integrated detection mechanism, namely IT-OCSVM was proposed, which is distributed in a SCADA network as a part of a distributed intrusion detection system (IDS), providing accurate data about the origin and the time of an intrusion.

Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local -- requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections -- making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3 benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security mechanisms.",

This, in turn, makes it challenging to endow them with fool-proof security solutions. In this paper, a unified model for interdependent gas-power-water infrastructure is presented and the security of this model is studied using a novel game-theoretic framework. In particular, a zero-sum noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation is 35\\% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the interdependent system to protect the grid from state deviations.",

In this work, a novel technique to authenticate PLCs is proposed that aims at raising the bar against powerful attackers while being compatible with real-time systems. The proposed technique captures timing information for each controller in a non-invasive manner. It is argued that Scan Cycle is a unique feature of a PLC that can be approximated passively by observing network traffic. An attacker that spoofs commands issued by the PLCs would deviate from such fingerprints. To detect replay attacks a PLC Watermarking technique is proposed. PLC Watermarking models the relationship between the scan cycle and the control logic by modeling the input/output as a function of request/response messages of a PLC. The proposed technique is validated on an operational water treatment plant (SWaT) and smart grid (EPIC) testbed.

Owing to their importance, PLCs are often the target of cyber attackers that are aiming at disrupting the operation of ICS, including the nation's critical infrastructure, by compromising the integrity of control logic execution. While a wide range of cybersecurity solutions for ICS have been proposed, they cannot counter strong adversaries with a foothold on the PLC devices, which could manipulate memory, I/O interface, or PLC logic itself. These days, many ICS devices in the market, including PLCs, run on ARM-based processors, and there is a promising security technology called ARM TrustZone, to offer a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on embedded devices. Envisioning that such a hardware-assisted security feature becomes available for ICS devices in the near future, this paper investigates the application of the ARM TrustZone TEE technology for enhancing the security of PLC. Our aim is to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the TEE-based PLCs through the proof-of-concept design and implementation using open-source software such as OP-TEE and OpenPLC. Our evaluation assesses the performance and resource consumption in real-world ICS configurations, and based on the results, we discuss bottlenecks in the OP-TEE secure OS towards a large-scale ICS and desired changes for its application on ICS devices.

Hence, research focuses on network anomaly detection based on meta--data (message sizes, timing, command sequence), or on the state values of the physical process. In this work we present a class of semantic network-based attacks against SCADA systems that are undetectable by the above mentioned anomaly detection. After hijacking the communication channels between the Human Machine Interface (HMI) and Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs), our attacks cause the HMI to present a fake view of the industrial process, deceiving the human operator into taking manual actions. Our most advanced attack also manipulates the messages generated by the operator's actions, reversing their semantic meaning while causing the HMI to present a view that is consistent with the attempted human actions. The attacks are totaly stealthy because the message sizes and timing, the command sequences, and the data values of the ICS's state all remain legitimate.   We implemented and tested several attack scenarios in the test lab of our local electric company, against a real HMI and real PLCs, separated by a commercial-grade firewall. We developed a real-time security assessment tool, that can simultaneously manipulate the communication to multiple PLCs and cause the HMI to display a coherent system--wide fake view. Our tool is configured with message-manipulating rules written in an ICS Attack Markup Language (IAML) we designed, which may be of independent interest. Our semantic attacks all successfully fooled the operator and brought the system to states of blackout and possible equipment damage.",

When deployed, the AquaSight system will provide an efficient way for individuals to secure an estimation of water quality, alerting local and national government to take action and potentially saving millions of lives worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Water systems are vital components of modern infrastructure, yet they are increasingly susceptible to sophisticated cyber attacks with potentially dire consequences on public health and safety. While state-of-the-art machine learning techniques effectively detect anomalies, contemporary model-agnostic attack attribution methods using LIME, SHAP, and LEMNA are deemed impractical for large-scale, interdependent water systems. This is due to the intricate interconnectivity and dynamic interactions that define these complex environments. Such methods primarily emphasize individual feature importance while falling short of addressing the crucial sensor-actuator interactions in water systems, which limits their effectiveness in identifying root cause attacks. To this end, we propose a novel model-agnostic Factorization Machines (FM)-based approach that capitalizes on water system sensor-actuator interactions to provide granular explanations and attributions for cyber attacks. For instance, an anomaly in an actuator pump activity can be attributed to a top root cause attack candidates, a list of water pressure sensors, which is derived from the underlying linear and quadratic effects captured by our approach. We validate our method using two real-world water system specific datasets, SWaT and WADI, demonstrating its superior performance over traditional attribution methods. In multi-feature cyber attack scenarios involving intricate sensor-actuator interactions, our FM-based attack attribution method effectively ranks attack root causes, achieving approximately 20% average improvement over SHAP and LEMNA.",

The IDS filters anomalous or spoofed data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder and Isolation Forest before validated data is logged via smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. The verified data feeds into a real-time DT model supporting leak detection, consumption forecasting, and predictive maintenance.

In this work, we report our experience on combining model learning and abstraction refinement to analyze a challenging system, i.e., a real-world Secure Water Treatment system (SWaT). Given a set of safety requirements, the objective is to either show that the system is safe with a high probability (so that a system shutdown is rarely triggered due to safety violation) or not. As the system is too complicated to be manually modeled, we apply latest automatic model learning techniques to construct a set of Markov chains through abstraction and refinement, based on two long system execution logs (one for training and the other for testing). For each probabilistic safety property, we either report it does not hold with a certain level of probabilistic confidence, or report that it holds by showing the evidence in the form of an abstract Markov chain. The Markov chains can subsequently be implemented as runtime monitors in SWaT.",

      "abstract": "There are hardly any data sets publicly available that can be used to evaluate intrusion detection algorithms. The biggest threat for industrial applications arises from state-sponsored and criminal groups. Often, formerly unknown exploits are employed by these attackers, so-called 0-day exploits. They cannot be discovered with signature-based intrusion detection. Thus, statistical or machine learning based anomaly detection lends itself readily. These methods especially, however, need a large amount of labelled training data. In this work, an exemplary industrial use case with real-world industrial hardware is presented. Siemens S7 Programmable Logic Controllers are used to control a real world-based control application using the OPC UA protocol: A pump, filling and emptying water tanks. This scenario is used to generate application specific network data. Furthermore, attacks are introduced into this data set. This is done in three ways: First, the normal process is monitored and captured. Common attacks are then synthetically introduced into this data set. Second, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller program and executed live, the traffic is captured as well. Third, malicious behaviour is implemented on the Programmable Logic Controller while still keeping the same output behaviour as in normal operation. An attacker could exploit an application but forge valid sensor output so that no anomaly is detected. Sensors are employed, capturing temperature, sound and flow of water to create data that can be correlated to the network data and used to still detect the attack. All data is labelled, containing the ground truth, meaning all attacks are known and no unknown attacks occur. This makes them perfect for training of anomaly detection algorithms. The data is published to enable security researchers to evaluate intrusion detection solutions.",

We present SCAPHY to detect ICS attacks in SCADA by leveraging the unique execution phases of SCADA to identify the limited set of legitimate behaviors to control the physical world in different phases, which differentiates from attackers activities. For example, it is typical for SCADA to setup ICS device objects during initialization, but anomalous during processcontrol. To extract unique behaviors of SCADA execution phases, SCAPHY first leverages open ICS conventions to generate a novel physical process dependency and impact graph (PDIG) to identify disruptive physical states. SCAPHY then uses PDIG to inform a physical process-aware dynamic analysis, whereby code paths of SCADA process-control execution is induced to reveal API call behaviors unique to legitimate process-control phases. Using this established behavior, SCAPHY selectively monitors attackers physical world-targeted activities that violates legitimate processcontrol behaviors. We evaluated SCAPHY at a U.S. national lab ICS testbed environment. Using diverse ICS deployment scenarios and attacks across 4 ICS industries, SCAPHY achieved 95% accuracy & 3.5% false positives (FP), compared to 47.5% accuracy and 25% FP of existing work. We analyze SCAPHYs resilience to futuristic attacks where attacker knows our approach.",

The proposed approach takes advantage of the special form of the nonlinear head loss equations and, after the transformation of variables and constraints, the WFP reduces to a linear optimization problem that can be efficiently solved by modern linear solvers. Ultimately, the proposed approach amounts to solving a series of linear optimization problems. We demonstrate the proposed approach through several case studies and show that the approach can model arbitrary network topologies and various types of valves and pumps, thus providing modeling flexibility. Under mild conditions, we show that the proposed linear approximation converges. We provide sensitivity analysis and discuss in detail the current limitations of our approach and suggest solutions to overcome these.

With the emergence of the smart grid, SCADA systems are increasingly required to be connected to more open systems and security becomes crucial. However, many of these SCADA systems have been deployed for decades and were initially not designed with security in mind. In particular, the field devices in these systems are vulnerable to false command injection from an intruding or compromised device. But implementing cryptographic defence on these old-generation devices is challenging due to their computation constraints. As a key requirement, solutions to protect legacy SCADA systems have to be an add-on. This paper discusses two add-on defence strategies for legacy SCADA systems -- the data diode and the detect-and-respond approach -- and compares their security guarantees and applicable scenarios. A generic architectural framework is also proposed to implement the detect-and-respond strategy, with an instantiation to demonstrate its practicality.",

Previous work showed that in many cases, it is possible to create an automata-based model of the traffic between each individual Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) and the SCADA server, and to use the model to detect anomalies in the traffic. When testing the validity of previous models, we noticed that overall, the models have difficulty in dealing with communication patterns that change over time. In this paper we show that in many cases the traffic exhibits phases in time, where each phase has a unique pattern, and the transition between the different phases is rather sharp. We suggest a method to automatically detect traffic phase shifts, and a new anomaly detection model that incorporates multiple phases of the traffic. Furthermore we present a new sampling mechanism for training set assembly, which enables the model to learn all phases during the training stage with lower complexity. The model presented has similar accuracy and much less permissiveness compared to the previous general DFA model. Moreover, the model can provide the operator with information about the state of the controlled process at any given time, as seen in the traffic phases.",

In order to manage the complexity and scale, we define four interrelated architectural layers, and uses the concept of viewpoints to focus on a subset of the system. We indicate the applicability of our approach in the context of SCADA system security analysis.",
