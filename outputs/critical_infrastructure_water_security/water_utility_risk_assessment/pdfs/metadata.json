      "abstract": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interconnected architectures that employ analog, digital, and communication resources for their interaction with the physical environment. CPS are the backbone of enterprise, industrial, and critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature, can have disastrous consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate power system operations, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies, as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS.",

This paper audits and quantifies security risks in three major AI governance standards: NIST AI RMF 1.0, UK's AI and Data Protection Risk Toolkit, and the EU's ALTAI. Using a novel risk assessment methodology, we develop four key metrics: Risk Severity Index (RSI), Attack Potential Index (AVPI), Compliance-Security Gap Percentage (CSGP), and Root Cause Vulnerability Score (RCVS). Our analysis identifies 136 concerns across the frameworks, exposing significant gaps. NIST fails to address 69.23 percent of identified risks, ALTAI has the highest attack vector vulnerability (AVPI = 0.51) and the ICO Toolkit has the largest compliance-security gap, with 80.00 percent of high-risk concerns remaining unresolved. Root cause analysis highlights under-defined processes (ALTAI RCVS = 033) and weak implementation guidance (NIST and ICO RCVS = 0.25) as critical weaknesses. These findings emphasize the need for stronger, enforceable security controls in AI compliance. We offer targeted recommendations to enhance security posture and bridge the gap between compliance and real-world AI risks.",

To effectively address and mitigate these security and compliance challenges, security risk management strategies are essential. However, it must adhere to well-established strategies and industry standards to ensure consistency, reliability, and compatibility both within and across organizations. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid risk assessment framework called TELSAFE, which employs probabilistic modeling for quantitative risk assessment and eliminates the influence of expert opinion bias. The framework encompasses both qualitative and quantitative assessment phases, facilitating effective risk management strategies tailored to the unique requirements of organizations.

      "abstract": "In an era of heightened digital interconnectedness, businesses increasingly rely on third-party vendors to enhance their operational capabilities. However, this growing dependency introduces significant security risks, making it crucial to develop a robust framework to mitigate potential vulnerabilities. This paper proposes a comprehensive secure framework for managing third-party vendor risk, integrating blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and immutability in vendor assessments and interactions. By leveraging blockchain, the framework enhances the integrity of vendor security audits, ensuring that vendor assessments remain up-to-date and tamperproof. This proposed framework leverages smart contracts to reduce human error while ensuring real-time monitoring of compliance and security controls. By evaluating critical security controls-such as data encryption, access control mechanisms, multi-factor authentication, and zero-trust architecture-this approach strengthens an organization's defense against emerging cyber threats. Additionally, continuous monitoring enabled by blockchain ensures the immutability and transparency of vendor compliance processes. In this paper, a case study on iHealth's transition to AWS Cloud demonstrates the practical implementation of the framework, showing a significant reduction in vulnerabilities and marked improvement in incident response times. Through the adoption of this blockchain-enabled approach, organizations can mitigate vendor risks, streamline compliance, and enhance their overall security posture.",

      "abstract": "Traditional techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security design either treat the cyber and physical systems independently, or do not address the specific vulnerabilities of real time embedded controllers and networks used to monitor and control physical processes. In this work, we develop and test an integrated model-based approach for CPS security risk assessment utilizing a CPS testbed with real-world industrial controllers and communication protocols. The testbed monitors and controls an exothermic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) simulated in real-time. CSTR is a fundamental process unit in many industries, including Oil \\& Gas, Petrochemicals, Water treatment, and nuclear industry. In addition, the process is rich in terms of hazardous scenarios that could be triggered by cyber attacks due to the lack of possible mechanical protection. The paper presents an integrated approach to analyze and design the cyber security system for a given CPS where the physical threats are identified first to guide the risk assessment process. A mathematical model is derived for the physical system using a hybrid automaton to enumerate potential hazardous states of the system. The cyber system is then analyzed using network and data flow models to develop the attack scenarios that may lead to the identified hazards. Finally, the attack scenarios are performed on the testbed and observations are obtained on the possible ways to prevent and mitigate the attacks. The insights gained from the experiments result in several key findings, including the expressive power of hybrid automaton in security risk assessment, the hazard development time and its impact on cyber security design, and the tight coupling between the physical and the cyber systems for CPS that requires an integrated design approach to achieve cost-effective and secure designs.",

      "abstract": "Fintech provides technological services to increase operational efficiency in financial institutions, but traditional perimeter-based defense mechanisms are insufficient against evolving cyber threats like insider attacks, malware intrusions, and Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs). These vulnerabilities expose Fintech organizations to significant risks, including financial losses and data breaches. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a blockchain-integrated Zero Trust framework, adhering to the principle of \"Never Trust, Always Verify.\" The framework uses Ethereum smart contracts to enforce Multi Factor Authentication (MFA), Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and Just-In-Time (JIT) access privileges, effectively mitigating credential theft and insider threats, the effect of malware and APT attacks.   The proposed solution transforms blockchain into a Policy Engine (PE) and Policy Enforcement Point (PEP), and policy storage, ensuring immutable access control and micro-segmentation. A decentralized application (DApp) prototype was developed and tested using STRIDE threat modeling, demonstrating resilience against spoofing, tampering, and privilege escalation. Comparative analysis with Perimeter-based systems revealed a trade-off: while the framework introduced a marginal latency increase (74.0 ms vs. 49.33 ms) and reduced throughput (30.77 vs. 50.0 requests/sec), it significantly enhanced security by eliminating single points of failure and enabling tamper-proof audit trails.   Experimental validation on a 200-node simulated network confirmed the framework's robustness, with future optimizations targeting Layer-2 solutions for scalability. This work bridges the gap between Zero Trust theory and practical blockchain implementation, offering Fintech organizations a decentralized, cost-effective security model.",

      "abstract": "With the increasing adoption of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines, securing software supply chains has become a critical challenge for modern DevOps teams. This study addresses these challenges by applying a structured threat modeling approach to identify and mitigate risks throughout the CI/CD lifecycle. By modeling a representative pipeline architecture incorporating tools such as GitHub, Jenkins, Docker, and Kubernetes and applying the STRIDE framework, we systematically analyze vulnerabilities at each stage, from source code management to deployment. Threats are documented and mapped to comprehensive security controls drawn from standards like NIST SP 800-218, OWASP Top 10 CI/CD risks, and the SLSA framework. Controls are further evaluated against SLSA maturity levels to assess improvements in trust and provenance. To operationalize these findings, the study outlines a practical security toolchain integration strategy grounded in Security as Code and Shift Left-Shield Right principles, enabling automated, enforceable security across the pipeline. This approach provides a pragmatic roadmap for enhancing CI/CD pipeline security against evolving software supply chain threats.",

This paper proposes a triad threat model focusing on users, servers and attackers to mitigate the security risk of miniapps. By following the principle of least privilege and the direction of permission consistency, we design a novel analysis framework for the security risk assessment of miniapps by this model. Then, we analyzed the correlation between the security risk assessment and the threat model associated with the miniapp. This analysis led to identifying potential scopes and categorisations with security risks. In the case study, we identify nine major categories of vulnerability issues, such as SQL injection, logical vulnerabilities and cross-site scripting. We also assessed a total of 50,628 security risk hazards and provided specific examples.",

Unknown vehicle security vulnerabilities trigger a race among adversaries to exploit the weaknesses and security experts to mitigate the vulnerability. In this study, we identified opportunities for adversaries to take control of the in-vehicle network, which can compromise the safety, privacy, reliability, efficiency, and security of the transportation system. This study contributes in three ways to the literature of ITS security and resiliency. First, we aggregate individual risks that are associated with hacking the in-vehicle network to determine system-level risk. Second, we employ a risk-based model to conduct a qualitative vulnerability-oriented risk assessment. Third, we identify the consequences of hacking the in-vehicle network through a risk-based approach, using an impact-likelihood matrix. The qualitative assessment communicates risk outcomes for policy analysis.

These systems include key sectors such as healthcare, energy, and water supply, which are crucial for societal and economic stability and are increasingly becoming prime targets for malicious actors, including state-sponsored hackers, seeking to disrupt national security and economic stability. This paper reviews literature on critical infrastructure security, focusing on penetration testing and exploit development. It explores four main questions: the characteristics of critical infrastructure, the role and challenges of penetration testing, methodologies of exploit development, and the contribution of these practices to security and resilience. The findings of this paper reveal inherent vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure and sophisticated threats posed by cyber adversaries. Penetration testing is highlighted as a vital tool for identifying and addressing security weaknesses, allowing organizations to fortify their defenses. Additionally, understanding exploit development helps anticipate and mitigate potential threats, leading to more robust security measures. The review underscores the necessity of continuous and proactive security assessments, advocating for integrating penetration testing and exploit development into regular security protocols. By doing so, organizations can preemptively identify and mitigate risks, enhancing the overall resilience of critical infrastructure. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for ongoing research and collaboration between the public and private sectors to develop innovative solutions for the evolving cyber threat landscape.

However, this technological advancement is accompanied by significant risks and vulnerabilities. Despite ongoing security enhancements, attackers persistently exploit these weaknesses, casting doubts on the overall trustworthiness of LLMs. Compounding the issue, organisations are deploying LLM-integrated systems without understanding the severity of potential consequences. Existing studies by OWASP and MITRE offer a general overview of threats and vulnerabilities but lack a method for directly and succinctly analysing the risks for security practitioners, developers, and key decision-makers who are working with this novel technology. To address this gap, we propose a risk assessment process using tools like the OWASP risk rating methodology which is used for traditional systems. We conduct scenario analysis to identify potential threat agents and map the dependent system components against vulnerability factors. Through this analysis, we assess the likelihood of a cyberattack. Subsequently, we conduct a thorough impact analysis to derive a comprehensive threat matrix. We also map threats against three key stakeholder groups: developers engaged in model fine-tuning, application developers utilizing third-party APIs, and end users. The proposed threat matrix provides a holistic evaluation of LLM-related risks, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for effective mitigation strategies. Our outlined process serves as an actionable and comprehensive tool for security practitioners, offering insights for resource management and enhancing the overall system security.",

As a result, a fragmented approach toward security has been observed, leading to new attack vectors and potential vulnerabilities. Other research has focused on single-cloud platforms or specific applications of multi-cloud environments. Therefore, there is a need for a holistic security and vulnerability assessment and defense strategy that applies to multi-cloud platforms. We perform a risk and vulnerability analysis to identify attack vectors from software, hardware, and the network, as well as interoperability security issues in multi-cloud environments. Applying the STRIDE and DREAD threat modeling methods, we present an analysis of the ecosystem across six attack vectors: cloud architecture, APIs, authentication, automation, management differences, and cybersecurity legislation. We quantitatively determine and rank the threats in multi-cloud environments and suggest mitigation strategies.",

This paper introduces 'AssessITS', an actionable method designed to provide organizations with comprehensive guidelines for conducting IT and cybersecurity risk assessments.

The paper outlines a step-by-step methodology that organizations can simply adopt to systematically identify, analyze, and mitigate IT risks. By simplifying complex principles into actionable procedures, this framework equips practitioners with the tools needed to perform risk assessments independently, without too much reliance on external vendors. The guidelines are developed to be straightforward, integrating practical evaluation metrics that allow for the precise quantification of asset values, threat levels, vulnerabilities, and impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability. This approach ensures that the risk assessment process is not only comprehensive but also accessible, enabling decision-makers to implement effective risk mitigation strategies customized to their unique operational contexts. 'AssessITS' aims to enable organizations to enhance their IT security strength through practical, actionable guidance based on internationally recognized standards.",

In response, this work proposes a graph-theoretic approach for risk modeling and assessment to address the lack of quantitative cybersecurity risk assessment frameworks for smart manufacturing systems. In doing so, first, threat attributes are represented using an attack graphical model derived from manufacturing cyberattack taxonomies. Attack taxonomies offer consistent structures to categorize threat attributes, and the graphical approach helps model their interdependence. Second, the graphs are analyzed to explore how threat events can propagate through the manufacturing value chain and identify the manufacturing assets that threat actors can access and compromise during a threat event. Third, the proposed method identifies the attack path that maximizes the likelihood of success and minimizes the attack detection probability, and then computes the associated cybersecurity risk. Finally, the proposed risk modeling and assessment framework is demonstrated via an interconnected smart manufacturing system illustrative example. Using the proposed approach, practitioners can identify critical connections and manufacturing assets requiring prioritized security controls and develop and deploy appropriate defense measures accordingly.",

This project carries out a detailed risk assessment for a case study organisation. It includes a comprehensive literature review analysing several professional views on pressing issues in Information security. In the risk register, five prominent assets were identified in respect to their owners. The work is followed by a qualitative analysis methodology to determine the magnitude of the potential threats and vulnerabilities. Collating these parameters enabled the valuation of individual risk per asset, per threat and vulnerability. Evaluating a risk appetite aided in prioritising and determining acceptable risks. From the analysis, it was deduced that human being posed the greatest Information security risk through intentional/ unintentional human error.

The increasing number of vulnerabilities, combined with resource constraints, makes addressing every vulnerability impractical, making effective prioritization essential. However, existing risk prioritization methods often rely on expert judgment or focus solely on exploit likelihood and consequences, lacking the granularity and adaptability needed for complex systems. This work introduces a graph-based framework for vulnerability patch prioritization that optimizes security by integrating diverse data sources and metrics into a universally applicable model. Refined risk metrics enable detailed assessments at the component, asset, and system levels. The framework employs two key graphs: a network communication graph to model potential attack paths and identify the shortest routes to critical assets, and a system dependency graph to capture risk propagation from exploited vulnerabilities across interconnected components. Asset criticality and component dependency rules systematically assess and mitigate risks. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods demonstrates superior accuracy in vulnerability patch ranking, with enhanced explainability. This framework advances vulnerability management and sets the stage for future research in adaptive cybersecurity strategies.",

Quantum attacks undermine current asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, rendering them ineffective. Even symmetric key cryptography is vulnerable, albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting longer keys or extended hash functions for security. Thus, current cryptographic solutions are inadequate against emerging quantum threats. Organizations must transition to quantum-safe environments with robust continuity plans and meticulous risk management. This study explores the challenges of migrating to quantum-safe cryptographic states, introducing a comprehensive security risk assessment framework. We propose a security risk assessment framework that examines vulnerabilities across algorithms, certificates, and protocols throughout the migration process (pre-migration, during migration, post-migration). We link these vulnerabilities to the STRIDE threat model to assess their impact and likelihood. Then, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for critical components like algorithms, public key infrastructures, and protocols. Our study not only identifies potential attacks and vulnerabilities at each layer and migration stage but also suggests possible countermeasures and alternatives to enhance system resilience, empowering organizations to construct a secure infrastructure for the quantum era. Through these efforts, we establish the foundation for enduring security in networked systems amid the challenges of the quantum era.",

The article presents the main methods of deploying web applications, ways to increase the level of information security at all stages of product development, compares different types of infrastructures and cloud computing providers, and analyzes modern tools used to automate processes. The cloud cluster was deployed using Terraform and the Jenkins pipeline, which is written in the Groovy programming language, which checks program code for vulnerabilities and allows you to fix violations at the earliest stages of developing secure web applications. The developed cluster implements the proposed algorithm for automated risk assessment based on the calculation (modeling) of threats and vulnerabilities of cloud infrastructure, which operates in real time, periodically collecting all information and adjusting the system in accordance with the risk and applied controls. The algorithm for calculating risk and losses is based on statistical data and the concept of the FAIR information risk assessment methodology. The risk value obtained using the proposed method is quantitative, which allows more efficient forecasting of information security costs in software development.",

Vulnerability assessment (VA) and Penetration Testing (PT) are widely adopted Security Compliance (SC) methods to identify security gaps and anticipate security breaches. In the computer networks context and despite the use of autonomous tools and systems, security compliance remains highly repetitive and resources consuming. In this paper, we proposed a novel method to tackle the ever-growing problem of efficiency and effectiveness in network infrastructures security auditing by formally introducing, designing, and developing an Expert-System Automated Security Compliance Framework (ESASCF) that enables industrial and open-source VA and PT tools and systems to extract, process, store and re-use the expertise in a human-expert way to allow direct application in similar scenarios or during the periodic re-testing. The implemented model was then integrated within the ESASCF and tested on different size networks and proved efficient in terms of time-efficiency and testing effectiveness allowing ESASCF to take over autonomously the SC in Re-testing and offloading Expert by automating repeated segments SC and thus enabling Experts to prioritize important tasks in Ad-Hoc compliance tests. The obtained results validate the performance enhancement notably by cutting the time required for an expert to 50% in the context of typical corporate networks first SC and 20% in re-testing, representing a significant cost-cutting. In addition, the framework allows a long-term impact illustrated in the knowledge extraction, generalization, and re-utilization, which enables better SC confidence independent of the human expert skills, coverage, and wrong decisions resulting in impactful false negatives.",

As a component of both the research and application sides of smart city development, accurate and precise modeling, simulation, and verification are key parts of a robust design and development tools that provide critical assistance in the prevention, detection, and recovery from abnormal behavior in the sensors, controllers, and actuators which make up a modern ICS system. However, while these tools have potential, there is currently a need for helper-tools to assist with their setup and configuration, if they are to be utilized widely. Existing state-of-the-art tools are often technically complex and difficult to customize for any given IoT/ICS processes. This is a serious barrier to entry for most technicians, engineers, researchers, and smart city planners, while slowing down the critical aspects of safety and security verification. To remedy this issue, we take a case study of existing simulation toolkits within the field of water management and expand on existing tools and algorithms with simplistic automated retrieval functionality using a much more in-depth and usable customization interface to accelerate simulation scenario design and implementation, allowing for customization of the cyber-physical network infrastructure and cyber attack scenarios. We additionally provide a novel in-tool-assessment of network's resilience according to graph theory path diversity. Further, we lay out a roadmap for future development and application of the proposed tool, including expansions on resiliency and potential vulnerability model checking, and discuss applications of our work to other fields relevant to the design and operation of smart cities.",

      "abstract": "As Canada prepares for the 2025 federal election, ensuring the integrity and security of the electoral process against cyber threats is crucial. Recent foreign interference in elections globally highlight the increasing sophistication of adversaries in exploiting technical and human vulnerabilities. Such vulnerabilities also exist in Canada's electoral system that relies on a complex network of IT systems, vendors, and personnel. To mitigate these vulnerabilities, a threat assessment is crucial to identify emerging threats, develop incident response capabilities, and build public trust and resilience against cyber threats. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive national cyber threat assessment, following the NIST Special Publication 800-30 framework, focusing on identifying and mitigating cybersecurity risks to the upcoming 2025 Canadian federal election. The research identifies three major threats: misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation (MDM) campaigns; attacks on critical infrastructure and election support systems; and espionage by malicious actors. Through detailed analysis, the assessment offers insights into the capabilities, intent, and potential impact of these threats. The paper also discusses emerging technologies and their influence on election security and proposes a multi-faceted approach to risk mitigation ahead of the election.",

      "abstract": "Cities are the drivers of socio-economic innovation, and are also forced to address the accelerating risk of failure in providing essential services such as water supply today and in the future. Here, we investigate the resilience of urban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that citizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability and robustness of critical system elements, or 'capitals' (water resources, infrastructure, finances, management efficacy and community adaptation). We translate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven contrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled systems dynamics model. Water services are disrupted by recurring stochastic shocks, and we simulate the dynamics of impact and recovery cycles. Resilience emerges under various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio. Systematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water resilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a continuous gradient from water insecure and non-resilient to secure and resilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge steady-state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and non-resilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have developed excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping point from high to low services and collapse. Where public services are insufficient, community adaptation improves water security and resilience to varying degrees. Our results highlight the need for resilience thinking in the governance of urban water systems under global change pressures.",

Ensuring their security is paramount to safeguard both individual users and the industries that depend on these networks. An essential condition for maintaining and improving the security posture of a system is the ability to effectively measure and monitor its security state. In this work we address the need for an objective measurement of the security state of 5G and future networks. We introduce a state machine model designed to capture the security life cycle of network functions and the transitions between different states within the life cycle. Such a model can be computed locally at each node, or hierarchically, by aggregating measurements into security domains or the whole network. We identify three essential security metrics -- attack surface exposure, impact of system vulnerabilities, and effectiveness of applied security controls -- that collectively form the basis for calculating the overall security score. With this approach, it is possible to provide a holistic understanding of the security posture, laying the foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks. Through practical examples, we illustrate the real-world application of our proposed methodology, offering valuable insights for developing risk management and informed decision-making strategies in 5G and 6G security operations and laying the foundation for effective security management in the expected dynamic threat landscape of 6G networks.",

To address this issue, we propose CyberWise Predictor, a framework designed for predicting and assessing security risks associated with microservice architectures.

Our experimental evaluation shows the effectiveness of CyberWise Predictor, achieving an average accuracy of 92% in automatically predicting vulnerability metrics for new vulnerabilities.

To deal with the security threats in high-speed, high dimensional, multimodal data and assets from eccentric stakeholders of the CAV ecosystem, this chapter presents and analyzes some of the state of art deep learning-based threat intelligence for attack detection. The frontiers in deep learning, namely Meta-Learning and Federated Learning, along with their challenges have been included in the chapter. We have proposed, trained, and tested the deep CNN-LSTM architecture for CAV threat intelligence; assessed and compared the performance of the proposed model against other deep learning algorithms such as DNN, CNN, LSTM. Our results indicate the superiority of the proposed model although DNN and 1d-CNN also achieved more than 99% of accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and AUC on the CAV-KDD dataset. The good performance of deep CNN-LSTM comes with the increased model complexity and cumbersome hyperparameters tuning. Still, there are open challenges on deep learning adoption in the CAV cybersecurity paradigm due to lack of properly developed protocols and policies, poorly defined privileges between stakeholders, costlier training, adversarial threats to the model, and poor generalizability of the model under out of data distributions.",

      "abstract": "Traditionally, applications that are used in large and small enterprises were deployed on \"bare metal\" servers installed with operating systems. Recently, the use of multiple virtual machines (VMs) on the same physical server was adopted due to cost reduction and flexibility. Nowadays, containers have become popular for application deployment due to smaller footprints than the VMs, their ability to start and stop more quickly, and their capability to pack the application binaries and their dependencies in standalone units for seamless portability. A typical container ecosystem includes a code repository (e.g., GitHub) where the container images are built from the codes and libraries and then pushed to the image registry (e.g., Docker Hub) for subsequent deployment as application containers. However, the pervasive use of containers also leads to a wide-range of security breaches, such as stealing credentials and sensitive data from image registry and code repository, carrying out DoS attacks, and gaining root access to the underlying host. In this paper, we first perform threat modeling on the containers ecosystem using the popular threat modeling framework, called STRIDE. Using STRIDE, we identify the vulnerabilities in each system component, and investigate potential security threats and their consequences. Then, we conduct a comprehensive survey on the existing countermeasures designed against the identified threats and vulnerabilities. In particular, we assess the strengths and weaknesses of the existing mitigation strategies designed against such threats. We believe that this work will help researchers and practitioners to gain a deeper understanding of the threat landscape in containers and the state-of-the-art countermeasures. We also discuss open research problems and future research directions in containers security, which may ignite further research to be done in this area.",

We begin by examining the conceptual foundations of Agentic AI and highlight its architectural distinctions from traditional AI agents. We then adapt and extend the AI TRiSM framework for Agentic AI, structured around four key pillars: Explainability, ModelOps, Security, Privacy and Governance, each contextualized to the challenges of multi-agent LLM systems. A novel risk taxonomy is proposed to capture the unique threats and vulnerabilities of Agentic AI, ranging from coordination failures to prompt-based adversarial manipulation. To support practical assessment in Agentic AI works, we introduce two novel metrics: the Component Synergy Score (CSS), which quantifies the quality of inter-agent collaboration, and the Tool Utilization Efficacy (TUE), which evaluates the efficiency of tool use within agent workflows. We further discuss strategies for improving explainability in Agentic AI , as well as approaches to enhancing security and privacy through encryption, adversarial robustness, and regulatory compliance. The review concludes with a research roadmap for the responsible development and deployment of Agentic AI, outlining critical directions to align emerging systems with TRiSM principles for safe, transparent, and accountable operation.",

In this paper we present a stochastic security framework for obtaining quantitative measures of security using attack graphs. Our model is novel as existing research in attack graph analysis do not consider the temporal aspects associated with the vulnerabilities, such as the availability of exploits and patches which can affect the overall network security based on how the vulnerabilities are interconnected and leveraged to compromise the system. Gaining a better understanding of the relationship between vulnerabilities and their lifecycle events can provide security practitioners a better understanding of their state of security. In order to have a more realistic representation of how the security state of the network would vary over time, a nonhomogeneous model is developed which incorporates a time dependent covariate, namely the vulnerability age. The daily transition-probability matrices are estimated using Frei's Vulnerability Lifecycle model. We also leverage the trusted CVSS metric domain to analyze how the total exploitability and impact measures evolve over a time period for a given network.",

However, this integration has led to an increase in the attack surface of the IMS network, making it more prone to various forms of cyber threats and attacks, including Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, SIP-based attacks, unauthorized access, etc. As a result, it is important to find a way to manage and assess the security of IMS networks, but there is a lack of a systematic approach to managing the identification of vulnerabilities and threats. In this paper, we propose a model and a threat-specific risk security modeling and assessment approach to model and assess the threats of the IMS network. This model will provide a structured methodology for representing and analyzing threats and attack scenarios in layers within a hierarchical model. The proposed model aims to enhance the security posture of IMS networks by improving vulnerability management, risk evaluation, and defense evaluation against cyber threats. We perform a preliminary evaluation based on vulnerability collected from the National Vulnerability Database for devices in the IMS network. The results showed that we can model and assess the threats of IMS networks. IMS network defenders can use this model to understand their security postures taking into account the threat and risk posed by each vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly expanded the attack surface for AI-driven cybersecurity threats, necessitating adaptive defense strategies. This paper introduces CyberSentinel, a unified, single-agent system for emergent threat detection, designed to identify and mitigate novel security risks in real time. CyberSentinel integrates: (1) Brute-force attack detection through SSH log analysis, (2) Phishing threat assessment using domain blacklists and heuristic URL scoring, and (3) Emergent threat detection via machine learning-based anomaly detection. By continuously adapting to evolving adversarial tactics, CyberSentinel strengthens proactive cybersecurity defense, addressing critical vulnerabilities in AI security.",

      "abstract": "As the number of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) continues to grow exponentially, security teams face increasingly difficult decisions about prioritization. Current approaches using Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) scores produce overwhelming volumes of high-priority vulnerabilities, while Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) and Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog offer valuable but incomplete perspectives on actual exploitation risk. We present Vulnerability Management Chaining, a decision tree framework that systematically integrates these three approaches to achieve efficient vulnerability prioritization. Our framework employs a two-stage evaluation process: first applying threat-based filtering using KEV membership or EPSS threshold $\\geq$ 0.088), then applying vulnerability severity assessment using CVSS scores $\\geq$ 7.0) to enable informed deprioritization. Experimental validation using 28,377 real-world vulnerabilities and vendor-reported exploitation data demonstrates 18-fold efficiency improvements while maintaining 85.6\\% coverage. Organizations can reduce urgent remediation workload by approximately 95\\%. The integration identifies 48 additional exploited vulnerabilities that neither KEV nor EPSS captures individually. Our framework uses exclusively open-source data, enabling immediate adoption regardless of organizational resources.",

      "abstract": "In multi-tier network systems, custom applications, Web services and platform environments, storing data and information assets becomes a challenge for any organisation. Although there are different methods to secure network systems, the best way to test the level of security is to conduct penetration testing. In this paper, we describe how we performed live penetration testing for a particular network, namely, 192.168.3.0/24 (Case Study) by identifying the system vulnerabilities to enable its penetration. After compromising the system, critical data (Flags) must be found, indicating our successful penetration. As professional penetration testers, we used an arsenal of penetration testing tools utilised by malicious actors on the internet, such as Nmap, Nessus, Sparta and Metasploit, etc. Typically, much effort was employed on reconnaissance & scanning phases, rather than system exploration, due to their importance in identifying security vulnerabilities in the system environment. The vulnerability analysis highlighted the most critical threats, which token is an advantage to gain access, namely, FTP services, HTTP, and human errors. However, comprising the system is not sufficient because the critical data (Flag) generally requires the administrators rights. Consequently, teams often examine the system to find a way to escalate privilege to the root level. Furthermore, some critical data (Flags) require decryption algorithms or the analysis of captured packets to make them readable. We found eight Flags and identified a system security breach. Mitigation strategies addressing the identified vulnerabilities are recommended to ensure the given networks are secured against future attacks.",
