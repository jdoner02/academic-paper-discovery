      "abstract": "Digital twins (DTs) help improve real-time monitoring and decision-making in water distribution systems. However, their connectivity makes them easy targets for cyberattacks such as scanning, denial-of-service (DoS), and unauthorized access. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that manage these systems often do not have enough budget or staff to build strong cybersecurity teams. To solve this problem, we present a Virtual Cybersecurity Department (VCD), an affordable and automated framework designed for SMEs. The VCD uses open-source tools like Zabbix for real-time monitoring, Suricata for network intrusion detection, Fail2Ban to block repeated login attempts, and simple firewall settings. To improve threat detection, we also add a machine-learning-based IDS trained on the OD-IDS2022 dataset using an improved ensemble model. This model detects cyber threats such as brute-force attacks, remote code execution (RCE), and network flooding, with 92\\% accuracy and fewer false alarms. Our solution gives SMEs a practical and efficient way to secure water systems using low-cost and easy-to-manage tools.",

      "abstract": "Distributed control systems (DCS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems were developed to reduce labour costs, and to allow system-wide monitoring and remote control from a central location. Control systems are widely used in critical infrastructures such as electric grid, natural gas, water and wastewater industries. While control systems can be vulnerable to a variety of types of cyber attacks that could have devastating consequences, little research has been done to secure the control systems. American Gas Association (AGA), IEC TC57 WG15, IEEE, NIST and National SCADA Test Bed Program have been actively designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA systems. American Gas Association (AGA) had originally been designing cryptographic standard to protect SCADA communication links and finished the report AGA 12 part 1. The AGA 12 part 2 has been transferred to IEEE P1711. This paper presents an attack on the protocols in the first draft of AGA standard (Wright et al., 2004). This attack shows that the security mechanisms in the first version of the AGA standard protocol could be easily defeated. We then propose a suite of security protocols optimised for SCADA/DCS systems which include: point-to-point secure channels, authenticated broadcast channels, authenticated emergency channels, and revised authenticated emergency channels. These protocols are designed to address the specific challenges that SCADA systems have.",

Nearly all of these systems utilize industrial Process Control Systems (PCS) to provide clean water, reliable electricity, critical manufacturing, and many other services within our communities - yet most of these PCS incorporate very little cyber-security countermeasures. Cyber-attacks on CI are becoming an attractive target. While many vendor solutions are starting to be deployed at CI sites, these solutions are largely based on network monitoring for intrusion detection. As such, they are not process-aware, nor do they account for inter dependencies among other CI sites in their community. What is proposed is an architecture for coordinating all CI within a community, which defines characteristics to enhance its integration, its resilience to failure and attack, and its ultimate acceptance by CI operators.",

However, lack of understanding and method to develop the technical security metrics may lead to unachievable security control objectives and incompetence of the implementation. This paper proposes a model of technical security metric to measure the effectiveness of network security management. The measurement is based on the effectiveness of security performance for (1) network security controls such as firewall, Intrusion Detection Prevention System (IDPS), switch, wireless access point, wireless controllers and network architecture; and (2) network services such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) and virtual private network (VPN). We use the Goal-Question-Metric (GQM) paradigm [1] which links the measurement goals to measurement questions and produce the metrics that can easily be interpreted in compliance with the requirements. The outcome of this research method is the introduction of network security management metric as an attribute to the Technical Security Metric (TSM) model. Apparently, the proposed TSM model may provide guidance for organizations in complying with effective measurement requirements of ISO/IEC 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS) standard. The proposed model will provide a comprehensive measurement and guidance to support the use of ISO/IEC 27004 ISMS Measurement template.",

      "abstract": "A city's critical infrastructure such as gas, water, and power systems, are largely interdependent since they share energy, computing, and communication resources. This, in turn, makes it challenging to endow them with fool-proof security solutions. In this paper, a unified model for interdependent gas-power-water infrastructure is presented and the security of this model is studied using a novel game-theoretic framework. In particular, a zero-sum noncooperative game is formulated between a malicious attacker who seeks to simultaneously alter the states of the gas-power-water critical infrastructure to increase the power generation cost and a defender who allocates communication resources over its attack detection filters in local areas to monitor the infrastructure. At the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium of this game, numerical results show that the expected power generation cost deviation is 35\\% lower than the one resulting from an equal allocation of resources over the local filters. The results also show that, at equilibrium, the interdependence of the power system on the natural gas and water systems can motivate the attacker to target the states of the water and natural gas systems to change the operational states of the power grid. Conversely, the defender allocates a portion of its resources to the water and natural gas states of the interdependent system to protect the grid from state deviations.",

However, the connectivity, embedded intelligence, and inclusion of a wide variety of novel sensors expose medical devices to severe cybersecurity threats, compromising patient safety and data privacy. In addition, many devices also have direct capacity - individually or in conjunction with other IoMT devices - to perform actions on the patient, such as delivering an electrical stimulus, administering a drug, or activating a motor, which can potentially be life-threatening. We provide a taxonomy of potential attacks targeting IoMT, presenting attack surfaces, vulnerabilities, and mitigation strategies across all layers of the IoMT architecture. It answers key questions such as: What makes IoMT security different from traditional IT security? What are the cybersecurity threats to medical devices? How can engineers design secure IoMT systems and protect hospital networks from cyberattacks? By analyzing historical cyber incidents, we highlight critical security gaps and propose practical security guidelines for medical device engineers and security professionals. This work bridges the gap between research and implementation, equipping healthcare stakeholders with actionable insights to build resilient and privacy-preserving IoMT ecosystems. Finally, we present the latest standardization and compliance frameworks, that IoMT security designers should be aware of.",

      "abstract": "As water distribution networks (WDNs) become increasingly connected with digital infrastructures, they face greater exposure to cyberattacks that threaten their operational integrity. Stealthy False Data Injection Attacks (SFDIAs) are particularly concerning, as they manipulate sensor data to compromise system operations while avoiding detection. While existing studies have focused on either detection methods or specific attack formulations, the relationship between attack sophistication, system knowledge requirements, and achievable impact remains unexplored. This paper presents a systematic analysis of sensor attacks against WDNs, investigating different combinations of physical constraints, state monitoring requirements, and intrusion detection evasion conditions. We propose several attack formulations that range from tailored strategies satisfying both physical and detection constraints to simpler measurement manipulations. The proposed attacks are simple and local -- requiring knowledge only of targeted sensors and their hydraulic connections -- making them scalable and practical. Through case studies on Net1 and Net3 benchmark networks, we demonstrate how these attacks can persistently increase operational costs and alter water flows while remaining undetected by monitoring systems for extended periods. The analysis provides utilities with insights for vulnerability assessment and motivates the development of protection strategies that combine physical and statistical security mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "The revolution of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and wearable technology has opened up great possibilities in remote patient monitoring. To streamline the diagnosis and treatment process, healthcare professionals are now adopting the wearable technology. However, these technologies also pose grave privacy risks and security concerns about the transfer and the logging of data transactions. One solution to protect privacy in healthcare is the use of blockchain technology. However, one of the primary problems with blockchain is its highly limited scalability. In this work here, we propose the utilization of a blockchain based protocol to provide secure management and analysis of data. In this paper we use recently introduced PoW based protocol GHOSTDAG, that generalizes Satoshi's blockchain to a direct acyclic graph of blocks (blockDAG) and provides high throughput while also avoiding the security-scalability problem. We use two blockchains based on the original GHOSTDAG protocol, one that is private and one that is public. Using a private blockchain, we create a system where we use smart contracts to analyze patient health data. If the smart contract for any reason issues an alert for an abnormal reading then the system makes the record of that event to the public blockchain. This would resolve the privacy and security vulnerabilities associated with remote patient monitoring and also the limited scalability problem of Satoshi's original blockchain.",

Developing a smart farming framework allows farmers to make more efficient use of inputs, thus protecting water quality and biodiversity habitat. Internet of Things (IoT), which has revolutionized every sphere of the economy, is being applied to agriculture by connecting on-farm devices and providing real-time monitoring of everything from environmental conditions to market signals through to animal health data. However, utilizing IoT means farming networks are now vulnerable to malicious activities, mostly when wireless communications are highly employed. With that in mind, this research aims to review different utilized communication technologies in smart farming. Moreover, possible cyber attacks are investigated to discover the vulnerabilities of communication technologies considering the most frequent cyber-attacks that have been happened.",

      "abstract": "In the aftermath of an extreme natural hazard, community residents must have access to functioning food retailers to maintain food security. Food security is dependent on supporting critical infrastructure systems, including electricity, potable water, and transportation. An understanding of the response of such interdependent networks and the process of post-disaster recovery is the cornerstone of an efficient emergency management plan. In this study, the interconnectedness among different critical facilities, such as electrical power networks, water networks, highway bridges, and food retailers, is modeled. The study considers various sources of uncertainty and complexity in the recovery process of a community to capture the stochastic behavior of the spatially distributed infrastructure systems. The study utilizes an approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework to allocate resources to restore infrastructure components efficiently. The proposed ADP scheme enables us to identify near-optimal restoration decisions at the community level. Furthermore, we employ a simulated annealing (SA) algorithm to complement the proposed ADP framework and to identify near-optimal actions accurately. In the sequel, we use the City of Gilroy, California, USA to illustrate the applicability of the proposed methodology following a severe earthquake. The approach can be implemented efficiently to identify practical policy interventions to hasten recovery of food systems and to reduce adverse food-insecurity impacts for other hazards and communities.",

These devices offer new services and experiences for the users; however, they also present new classes of security threats pertaining to data and device safety and user privacy. In this article, we first analyze the potential threats presented by these devices connected to edge networks. We then propose Securebox: a new cloud-driven, low cost Security-as-a-Service solution that applies Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to improve network monitoring, security and management. Securebox enables remote management of networks through a cloud security service (CSS) with minimal user intervention required. To reduce costs and improve the scalability, Securebox is based on virtualized middleboxes provided by CSS. Our proposal differs from the existing solutions by integrating the SDN and cloud into a unified edge security solution, and by offering a collaborative protection mechanism that enables rapid security policy dissemination across all connected networks in mitigating new threats or attacks detected by the system. We have implemented two Securebox prototypes, using a low-cost Raspberry-PI and off-the-shelf fanless PC. Our system evaluation has shown that Securebox can achieve automatic network security and be deployed incrementally to the infrastructure with low management overhead.",

It performs a battery of over 120 in-browser security tests in situ, providing fine-grained diagnostics of security policies and features that network-level or os-level tools cannot observe. This yields insights into how well a browser enforces critical client-side security invariants. We detail the motivation for such a framework, describe its architecture and implementation, and dive into the technical design of numerous test modules (covering the same-origin policy, cross-origin resource sharing, content security policy, sandboxing, XSS protection, extension interference via WeakRefs, permissions audits, garbage collection behavior, cryptographic APIs, SSL certificate validation, advanced web platform security features like SharedArrayBuffer, Content filtering controls ,and internal network accessibility). We then present an experimental evaluation across different browsers and enterprise scenarios, highlighting gaps in legacy browsers and common misconfigurations. Finally, we discuss the security and privacy implications of our findings, compare with related work in browser security and enterprise endpoint solutions, and outline future enhancements such as real-time posture monitoring and SIEM integration.",

Our streaming approach trains models incrementally as each log record is processed, thereby adjusting to concept drift resulting from changing attacks. Further, we designed a community sharing approach which federates learning through merging models without the need to share sensitive cyber-log data.

      "abstract": "The increasing integration of modern IT technologies into OT technologies and industrial systems is expanding the vulnerability surface of legacy infrastructures, which often rely on outdated protocols and resource-constrained devices. Recent security incidents in safety-critical industries exposed how the lack of proper message authentication enables attackers to inject malicious commands or alter system behavior, revealing fundamental security weaknesses in existing architectures. These shortcomings have thus prompted new regulations that emphasize the pressing need to strengthen cybersecurity, particularly in legacy systems. Authentication is widely recognized as a fundamental security measure that enhances system resilience. However, its adoption in legacy industrial environments is limited due to practical challenges like backward compatibility, message format changes, and hardware replacement or upgrades costs. In this paper, we introduce ACRIC, a message authentication solution to secure legacy industrial communications explicitly tailored to overcome those challenges all at once. ACRIC uniquely leverages cryptographic computations applied to the CRC field - already present in most industrial communication protocols - ensuring robust message integrity protection and authentication without requiring additional hardware or modifications to existing message formats. ACRIC's backward compatibility and protocol-agnostic nature enable coexistence with non-secured devices, thus facilitating gradual security upgrades in legacy infrastructures. Formal security assessment and experimental evaluation on an industrial-grade testbed demonstrate that ACRIC provides robust security guarantees with minimal computational overhead (~ 4 us). These results underscore ACRIC's practicality, cost-effectiveness, and suitability for effective adoption in resource-constrained industrial environments.",

      "abstract": "Cyber Essentials (CE) comprise a set of controls designed to protect organisations, irrespective of their size, against cyber attacks. The controls are firewalls, secure configuration, user access control, malware protection & security update management. In this work, we explore the extent to which CE remains robust against an ever-evolving threat landscape. To that end, we reconstruct 45 breaches mapped to MiTRE ATT&CK using an Incident Fault Tree ( IFT ) approach. Our method reveals the intersections where the placement of controls could have protected organisations. Then we identify appropriate Cyber Essential controls and/or Additional Controls for these vulnerable intersections. Our results show that CE controls can effectively protect against most attacks during the initial attack phase. However, they may need to be complemented with additional Controls if the attack proceeds further into organisational systems & networks. The Additional Controls (AC) we identify include back-ups, security awareness, logging and monitoring. Our analysis brings to the fore a foundational issue as to whether controls should exclude recovery and focus only on pre-emption. The latter makes the strong assumption that a prior identification of all controls in a dynamic threat landscape is indeed possible. Furthermore, any potential broadening of technical controls entails re-scoping the skills that are required for a Cyber Essentials (CE) assessor. To that end, we suggest human factors and security operations and incident management as two potential knowledge areas from Cyber Security Body of Knowledge (CyBOK) if there is any broadening of CE based on these findings.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity is essential for the protection of companies against cyber threats. Traditionally, cybersecurity experts assess and improve a company's capabilities. However, many small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) consider such services not to be affordable. We explore an alternative do-it-yourself (DIY) approach to bringing cybersecurity to SMBs. Our method and tool, CYSEC, implements the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) to guide and motivate SMBs to adopt good cybersecurity practices. CYSEC uses assessment questions and recommendations to communicate cybersecurity knowledge to the end-user SMBs and encourage self-motivated change. In this paper, the operationalisation of SDT in CYSEC is presented and the results of a multi-case study shown that offer insight into how SMBs adopted cybersecurity practices with CYSEC. Effective automated cybersecurity communication depended on the SMB's hands-on skills, tools adaptedness, and the users' willingness to documenting confidential information. The SMBs wanted to learn in simple, incremental steps, allowing them to understand what they do. An SMB's motivation to improve security depended on the fitness of assessment questions and recommendations with the SMB's business model and IT infrastructure. The results of this study indicate that automated counselling can help many SMBs in security adoption.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a novel Communication and Obfuscation Management Architecture (COMA) to handle the storage of the obfuscation key and to secure the communication to/from untrusted yet obfuscated circuits. COMA addresses three challenges related to the obfuscated circuits: First, it removes the need for the storage of the obfuscation unlock key at the untrusted chip. Second, it implements a mechanism by which the key sent for unlocking an obfuscated circuit changes after each activation (even for the same device), transforming the key into a dynamically changing license. Third, it protects the communication to/from the COMA protected device and additionally introduces two novel mechanisms for the exchange of data to/from COMA protected architectures: (1) a highly secure but slow double encryption, which is used for exchange of key and sensitive data (2) a high-performance and low-energy yet leaky encryption, secured by means of frequent key renewal. We demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art key management architectures, COMA reduces the area overhead by 14%, while allowing additional features including unique chip authentication, enabling activation as a service (for IoT devices), reducing the side channel threats on key management architecture, and providing two new means of secure communication to/from an untrusted chip.",

This is because the server has the authority for all nodes that share the security protection. Hence if the attackers successfully tamper the server, the organization will be in trouble. Also, the settings and policies saved on the server are usually not cryptographically secured and ensured with hash. Thus, changing the settings from alternative way is feasible, without causing the security solution to raise any alarms. To mitigate these issues, in this work, we develop BlockFW - a blockchain-based rule sharing firewall to create a managed security mechanism, which provides validation and monitoring from multiple nodes. For BlockFW, all occurred transactions are cryptographically protected to ensure its integrity, making tampering attempts in utmost challenging for attackers. In the evaluation, we explore the performance of BlockFW under several adversarial conditions and demonstrate its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Long-term deployment of a fleet of mobile robots requires reliable and secure two-way communication channels between individual robots and remote human operators for supervision and tasking. Existing open-source solutions to this problem degrade in performance in challenging real-world situations such as intermittent and low-bandwidth connectivity, do not provide security control options, and can be computationally expensive on hardware-constrained mobile robot platforms. In this paper, we present Robofleet, a lightweight open-source system which provides inter-robot communication, remote monitoring, and remote tasking for a fleet of ROS-enabled service-mobile robots that is designed with the practical goals of resilience to network variance and security control in mind.   Robofleet supports multi-user, multi-robot communication via a central server. This architecture deduplicates network traffic between robots, significantly reducing overall network load when compared with native ROS communication. This server also functions as a single entrypoint into the system, enabling security control and user authentication. Individual robots run the lightweight Robofleet client, which is responsible for exchanging messages with the Robofleet server. It automatically adapts to adverse network conditions through backpressure monitoring as well as topic-level priority control, ensuring that safety-critical messages are successfully transmitted. Finally, the system includes a web-based visualization tool that can be run on any internet-connected, browser-enabled device to monitor and control the fleet.   We compare Robofleet to existing methods of robotic communication, and demonstrate that it provides superior resilience to network variance while maintaining performance that exceeds that of widely-used systems.",

The IDS filters anomalous or spoofed data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoder and Isolation Forest before validated data is logged via smart contracts on a private Ethereum blockchain using Proof of Authority (PoA) consensus. The verified data feeds into a real-time DT model supporting leak detection, consumption forecasting, and predictive maintenance. Experimental results demonstrate that the system achieves over 80 transactions per second (TPS) with under 2 seconds of latency while remaining cost-effective and scalable for up to 1,000 smart meters.

As such security operations monitoring is now an integral part of most business operations. SOCs (used interchangeably as CSOCs) are responsible for continuously and protectively monitoring business services, IT systems and infrastructures to identify vulnerabilities, detect cyber-attacks, security breaches, policy violations, and to respond to cyber incidents swiftly. They must also ensure that security events and alerts are triaged and analysed, while coordinating and managing cyber incidents to resolution. Because SOCs are vital, it is also necessary that SOCs are effective. But unfortunately, the effectiveness of SOCs are a widespread concern and a focus of boundless debate. In this paper, we identify and discuss some of the pertinent challenges to building an effective SOC. We investigate some of the factors contributing to the inefficiencies in SOCs and explain some of the challenges they face.

However, this environment limits the use of existing cybersecurity frameworks and tools, which reduces observability and situational awareness capabilities (e.g., risk assessment, incident response). In addition, existing security frameworks for serverless applications do not generalize well to all application architectures and usually require adaptation, specialized expertise, etc. for use in fully managed serverless environments. In this paper, we introduce a three-layer security scheme for applications deployed in fully managed serverless environments. The first two layers involve a unique ontology based solely on serverless logs which is used to transform them into a unified application activity knowledge graph. In the third layer, we address the need for observability and situational awareness capabilities by implementing two situational awareness tools that utilizes the graph-based representation: 1) An incident response dashboard that leverages the ontology to visualize and examine application activity logs in the context of cybersecurity alerts. Our user study showed that the dashboard enabled participants to respond more accurately and quickly to new security alerts than the baseline tool. 2) A criticality of asset (CoA) risk assessment framework that enables efficient expert-based prioritization in cybersecurity contexts.",

The penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including roof-top solar panels, energy storage, electric vehicles, etc., enables the on-site generation of economically dispatchable power curtailing operational costs. The effective control of DERs requires communication between utilities and DER system operators. The communication protocols employed for DER management and control lack sophisticated cybersecurity features and can compromise power systems secure operation if malicious control commands are issued to DERs. To overcome authentication-related protocol issues, we present a bolt-on security extension that can be implemented on Distributed Network Protocol v3 (DNP3). We port an authentication framework, DERauth, into DNP3, and utilize real-time measurements from a simulated DER battery energy storage system to enhance communication security. We evaluate our framework in a testbed setup using DNP3 master and outstation devices performing secure authentication by leveraging the entropy of DERs.",

      "abstract": "Rice cultivation consumes 24-30% of global freshwater, creating critical water management challenges in major rice-producing regions. Sustainable irrigation practices like direct seeded rice (DSR) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD) can reduce water use by 20-40% while maintaining yields, helping secure long-term agricultural productivity as water scarcity intensifies - a key component of the Zero Hunger Sustainable Development Goal. However, limited data on adoption rates of these practices prevents evidence-based policymaking and targeted resource allocation. We developed a novel remote sensing framework to monitor sustainable water management practices at scale in Punjab, India - a region facing severe groundwater depletion of 41.6 cm/year. To collect essential ground truth data, we partnered with the Nature Conservancy's Promoting Regenerative and No-burn Agriculture (PRANA) program, which trained approximately 1,400 farmers on water-saving techniques while documenting their field-level practices. Using this data, we created a classification system with Sentinel-1 satellite imagery that separates water management along sowing and irrigation dimensions. Our approach achieved a 78% F1-score in distinguishing DSR from traditional puddled transplanted rice without requiring prior knowledge of planting dates. We demonstrated scalability by mapping DSR adoption across approximately 3 million agricultural plots in Punjab, with district-level predictions showing strong correlation (Pearson=0.77, RBO= 0.77) with government records. This study provides policymakers with a powerful tool to track sustainable water management adoption, target interventions, and measure program impacts at scale.",

This paper is focused on the security and privacy challenges of cloud computing with specific reference to user authentication and access management for cloud SaaS applications. The suggested model uses a framework that harnesses the stateless and secure nature of JWT for client authentication and session management. Furthermore, authorized access to protected cloud SaaS resources have been efficiently managed. Accordingly, a Policy Match Gate (PMG) component and a Policy Activity Monitor (PAM) component have been introduced. In addition, other subcomponents such as a Policy Validation Unit (PVU) and a Policy Proxy DB (PPDB) have also been established for optimized service delivery. A theoretical analysis of the proposed model portrays a system that is secure, lightweight and highly scalable for improved cloud resource security and management.",

      "abstract": "Using communication services is a common part of everyday life in a personal or business context. Communication services include Internet services like voice services, chat service, and web 2.0 technologies (wikis, blogs, etc), but other usage areas like home energy management and eMobility are will be increasingly tackled. Such communication services typically authenticate participants. For this identities of some kind are used to identify the communication peer to the user of a service or to the service itself. Calling line identification used in the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) used for Voice over IP (VoIP) is just one example. Authentication and identification of eCar users for accounting during charging of the eCar is another example. Also, further mechanisms rely on identities, e.g., whitelists defining allowed communication peers. Trusted identities prevent identity spoofing, hence are a basic building block for the protection of communication. However, providing trusted identities in a practical way is still a difficult problem and too often application specific identities are used, making identity handling a hassle. Nowadays, many countries introduced electronic identity cards, e.g., the German \"Elektronischer Personalausweis\" (ePA). As many German citizens will possess an ePA soon, it can be used as security token to provide trusted identities. Especially new usage areas (like eMobility) should from the start be based on the ubiquitous availability of trusted identities. This paper describes how identity cards can be integrated within three domains: home energy management, vehicle-2-grid communication, and SIP-based voice over IP telephony. In all three domains, identity cards are used to reliably identify users and authenticate participants. As an example for an electronic identity card, this paper focuses on the German ePA.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, security is becoming a major issue and concern. More and more organizations like hospitals, metropolis or banks are under cyberattacks and have to improve their network infrastructure security. The first prerequisites are to authenticate users, to provide identity and to grant just the needed and useful accesses. These requirements can be solved by implementing a Single Sign-On (SSO) solution. It is an authentication scheme that permits a user to log in with a single identity to any of several related, yet independent, systems. It allows users to log in once and to access services without authenticating again. SSO solutions are classified depending on Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting features. The 'AAA' acronym defines a framework for intelligently controlling access to resources, enforcing security policies, auditing usage, and providing the information necessary to bill for services. These combined processes are considered important for effective network management and cybersecurity. LemonLDAP::NG (LL::NG) is a full AAA WebSSO solution. It implements all standard authentication and identity federation (IdF) protocols. The main LL::NG's advantages compared to other products are its plug-in engine and its advanced handlerbased protection mechanism that can be employed to protect Server2Server exchanges or to offer the SSO as a Service, a solution to implement a full DevOps architecture. LL::NG is a community and professional project mainly employed by the French government to secure Police, Finance or Justice Ministries and a French mobile operator IT infrastructures since 2010. But for several years, contributions come from all around the world and LL::NG is becoming more and more popular.",

Through prototype validation in real-world library settings, we demonstrate the framework's practical applicability and its capacity to significantly reduce budgetary constraints on public facilities. The advanced and innovative nature of our model is evident from its successful implementation in prototype testing. We plan to extend the framework's scope to include a wider array of public facilities and to integrate it with cutting-edge cybersecurity technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) security and machine learning algorithms for threat detection and response. This will result in a comprehensive and proactive maintenance system that not only bolsters the security of intelligent devices but also utilizes machine learning for automated analysis and real-time threat mitigation. By incorporating these advanced cybersecurity elements, our framework will be well-positioned to tackle the dynamic challenges of modern public infrastructure, ensuring robust protection against potential threats and enabling facilities to anticipate and prevent failures, leading to substantial cost savings and enhanced service quality.",

      "abstract": "As new technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) are integrated into Critical National Infrastructures (CNI), new cybersecurity threats emerge that require specific security solutions. Approaches used for analysis include the modelling and simulation of critical infrastructure systems using attributes, functionalities, operations, and behaviours to support various security analysis viewpoints, recognising and appropriately managing associated security risks. With several critical infrastructure protection approaches available, the question of how to effectively model the complex behaviour of interconnected CNI elements and to configure their protection as a system-of-systems remains a challenge. Using a systematic review approach, existing critical infrastructure protection approaches (tools and techniques) are examined to determine their suitability given trends like IoT, and effective security modelling and analysis issues. It is found that empirical-based, agent-based, system dynamics-based, and network-based modelling are more commonly applied than economic-based and equation-based techniques, and empirical-based modelling is the most widely used. The energy and transportation critical infrastructure sectors reflect the most responsive sectors, and no one Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) approach - tool, technique, methodology or framework -- provides a fit-for-all capacity for all-round attribute modelling and simulation of security risks. Typically, deciding factors for CIP choices to adopt are often dominated by trade-offs between complexity of use and popularity of approach, as well as between specificity and generality of application in sectors.",

However, as these vehicles become more connected, cybersecurity threats have emerged as a serious concern. Protecting the security and integrity of autonomous systems is essential to prevent malicious activities that can harm passengers, other road users, and the overall transportation network. This paper focuses on addressing the cybersecurity issues in autonomous vehicles by examining the challenges and risks involved, which are important for building a secure future. Since autonomous vehicles depend on the communication between sensors, artificial intelligence, external infrastructure, and other systems, they are exposed to different types of cyber threats. A cybersecurity breach in an autonomous vehicle can cause serious problems, including a loss of public trust and safety. Therefore, it is very important to develop and apply strong cybersecurity measures to support the growth and acceptance of self-driving cars. This paper discusses major cybersecurity challenges like vulnerabilities in software and hardware, risks from wireless communication, and threats through external interfaces. It also reviews existing solutions such as secure software development, intrusion detection systems, cryptographic protocols, and anomaly detection methods. Additionally, the paper highlights the role of regulatory bodies, industry collaborations, and cybersecurity standards in creating a secure environment for autonomous vehicles. Setting clear rules and best practices is necessary for consistent protection across manufacturers and regions. By analyzing the current cybersecurity landscape and suggesting practical countermeasures, this paper aims to contribute to the safe development and public trust of autonomous vehicle technology.",

The topology information, however, can be inferred through end-to-end measurements using various inference algorithms, posing significant security risks to network infrastructure. While existing protection methods attempt to secure topology information by modifying end-to-end measurements, they often require complex computation and sophisticated modification strategies, making real-time protection challenging. Moreover, these modifications typically render the measurements unusable for network monitoring, even by trusted users. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving framework that addresses these limitations. Our approach provides efficient topology protection while maintaining the utility of measurements for authorized network monitoring. Through extensive evaluation on both simulated and real-world networks, we demonstrate that our framework achieves superior privacy protection compared to existing methods while enabling trusted users to effectively monitor network performance. Our solution offers a practical approach for organizations to protect sensitive topology information without sacrificing their network monitoring capabilities.",

In cloud, user's data is stored in one or more remote server(s) which poses more security challenges for the system. One of the most important concerns is to protect user's sensitive information from other users and hackers that may cause data leakage in cloud storage. Having this security challenge in mind, this paper focuses on the development of a more secure cloud environment, to determine the trust of the service requesting authorities by using a novel VM (Virtual Machine) monitoring system. Moreover, this research aims towards proposing a new trusted and collaborative agent-based two-tier framework, titled WAY (Who Are You?), to protect cloud resources. The framework can be used to provide security in network, infrastructure, as well as data storage in a heterogeneous cloud platform. If the trust updating policy is based on network activities, then the framework can provide network security. Similarly, it provides storage security by monitoring unauthorized access activities by the Cloud Service Users (CSU). Infrastructure security can be provided by monitoring the use of privileged instructions within the isolated VMs. The uniqueness of the proposed security solution lies in the fact that it ensures security and privacy both at the service provider level as well as at the user level in a cloud environment.",

With the increased connectivity of wearable devices, they will become integral to remote healthcare solutions.

When an anomaly of a patient is detected, it will be alerted to healthcare professionals for proper intervention. Remote healthcare offers substantial benefits for both patients and healthcare providers as patients may avoid expensive in-patient care by choosing the comfort of staying at home while being monitored after a surgery and healthcare providers can resolve challenges between limited resources and a growing population.   While remote healthcare through wearable devices is ubiquitous and affordable, it raises concerns about patient privacy. Patients may wonder: Is my data stored in the cloud safe? Can anyone access and manipulate my data for blackmailing? Hence, securing patient private information end-to-end becomes crucial.

Since the cyber landscape is an ever-evolving scenario, one must keep upgrading its security systems to enhance the security of the infrastructure. Tools like Security Information and Event Management (SIEM), Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR), Threat Intelligence Platform (TIP), Information Technology Service Management (ITSM), along with other defensive techniques like Intrusion Detection System (IDS), Intrusion Protection System (IPS), and many others enhance the cyber security posture of the infrastructure. However, the proposed protection mechanisms have their limitations, they are insufficient to ensure security, and the attacker penetrates the network. Deception technology, along with Honeypots, provides a false sense of vulnerability in the target systems to the attackers. The attacker deceived reveals threat intel about their modus operandi. We have developed a Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Engine that dynamically deploys custom honeypots inside the internal network infrastructure based on the attacker's behavior. The architecture is robust enough to support multiple VLANs connected to the system and used for orchestration. The presence of botnet traffic and DDOS attacks on the honeypots in the network is detected, along with a malware collection system. After being exposed to live traffic for four days, our engine dynamically orchestrated the honeypots 40 times, detected 7823 attacks, 965 DDOS attack packets, and three malicious samples. While our experiments with static honeypots show an average attacker engagement time of 102 seconds per instance, our SOAR Engine-based dynamic honeypots engage attackers on average 3148 seconds.",

      "abstract": "Smart cities deploy large numbers of sensors and collect a tremendous amount of data from them. For example, Advanced Metering Infrastructures (AMIs), which consist of physical meters that collect usage data about public utilities such as power and water, are an important building block in a smart city. In a typical sensor network, the measurement devices are connected through a computer network, which exposes them to cyber attacks. Furthermore, the data is centrally managed at the operator's servers, making it vulnerable to insider threats.   Our goal is to protect the integrity of data collected by large-scale sensor networks and the firmware in measurement devices from cyber attacks and insider threats. To this end, we first develop a comprehensive threat model for attacks against data and firmware integrity, which can target any of the stakeholders in the operation of the sensor network. Next, we use our threat model to analyze existing defense mechanisms, including signature checks, remote firmware attestation, anomaly detection, and blockchain-based secure logs. However, the large size of the Trusted Computing Base and a lack of scalability limit the applicability of these existing mechanisms. We propose the Feather-Light Blockchain Infrastructure (FLBI) framework to address these limitations. Our framework leverages a two-layer architecture and cryptographic threshold signature chains to support large networks of low-capacity devices such as meters and data aggregators. We have fully implemented the FLBI's end-to-end functionality on the Hyperledger Fabric and private Ethereum blockchain platforms. Our experiments show that the FLBI is able to support millions of end devices.",

      "abstract": "Traditional techniques for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) security design either treat the cyber and physical systems independently, or do not address the specific vulnerabilities of real time embedded controllers and networks used to monitor and control physical processes. In this work, we develop and test an integrated model-based approach for CPS security risk assessment utilizing a CPS testbed with real-world industrial controllers and communication protocols. The testbed monitors and controls an exothermic Continuous Stirred Tank Reactor (CSTR) simulated in real-time. CSTR is a fundamental process unit in many industries, including Oil \\& Gas, Petrochemicals, Water treatment, and nuclear industry. In addition, the process is rich in terms of hazardous scenarios that could be triggered by cyber attacks due to the lack of possible mechanical protection. The paper presents an integrated approach to analyze and design the cyber security system for a given CPS where the physical threats are identified first to guide the risk assessment process. A mathematical model is derived for the physical system using a hybrid automaton to enumerate potential hazardous states of the system. The cyber system is then analyzed using network and data flow models to develop the attack scenarios that may lead to the identified hazards. Finally, the attack scenarios are performed on the testbed and observations are obtained on the possible ways to prevent and mitigate the attacks. The insights gained from the experiments result in several key findings, including the expressive power of hybrid automaton in security risk assessment, the hazard development time and its impact on cyber security design, and the tight coupling between the physical and the cyber systems for CPS that requires an integrated design approach to achieve cost-effective and secure designs.",

Owing to their importance, PLCs are often the target of cyber attackers that are aiming at disrupting the operation of ICS, including the nation's critical infrastructure, by compromising the integrity of control logic execution. While a wide range of cybersecurity solutions for ICS have been proposed, they cannot counter strong adversaries with a foothold on the PLC devices, which could manipulate memory, I/O interface, or PLC logic itself. These days, many ICS devices in the market, including PLCs, run on ARM-based processors, and there is a promising security technology called ARM TrustZone, to offer a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) on embedded devices. Envisioning that such a hardware-assisted security feature becomes available for ICS devices in the near future, this paper investigates the application of the ARM TrustZone TEE technology for enhancing the security of PLC. Our aim is to evaluate the feasibility and practicality of the TEE-based PLCs through the proof-of-concept design and implementation using open-source software such as OP-TEE and OpenPLC. Our evaluation assesses the performance and resource consumption in real-world ICS configurations, and based on the results, we discuss bottlenecks in the OP-TEE secure OS towards a large-scale ICS and desired changes for its application on ICS devices.

      "abstract": "A model of cloud services is emerging whereby a few trusted providers manage the underlying hardware and communications whereas many companies build on this infrastructure to offer higher level, cloud-hosted PaaS services and/or SaaS applications. From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen to be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and later by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly it is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation and protection of data managed by those applications. They also require flexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional cloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government provides many related services for its citizens on a common platform. Similar considerations apply to the end-users of applications. But in particular, the incorporation of cloud services within `Internet of Things' architectures is driving the requirements for both protection and cross-application data sharing.   These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control is application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement points, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows; a crucial issue once data has left its owner's control by cloud-hosted applications and within cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in addition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties of the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing owners' dataflow policy with regard to protection and sharing, as well as safeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log associated with IFC provides transparency, giving configurable system-wide visibility over data flows. [...]",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the healthcare sector's transition to digital platforms has intensified concerns over data security, privacy, and scalability. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized, secure, and immutable solution to these challenges. This paper presents a scalable, multi-layered blockchain architecture for secure Electronic Health Record (EHR) sharing and drug supply chain management. The proposed framework introduces five distinct layers that enhance system performance, security, and patient-centric access control. By implementing parallelism, the system significantly increases transaction throughput and reduces network traffic. Our solution ensures data integrity, privacy, and interoperability, making it compatible with existing healthcare systems. Experimental results, conducted using the Caliper benchmark, demonstrate notable improvements in transaction throughput and reduced communication overhead. Additionally, the framework provides transparency and real-time drug supply chain monitoring, empowering decision-makers with critical insights.",

      "abstract": "The cyber-physical system of electricity power networks utilizes supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA), which are inherently vulnerable to cyber threats if usually connected with the internet technology (IT). Power system operations are conducted through communication systems that are mapped to standards, protocols, ports, and addresses. Real-time situational awareness is a standard term with implications and applications in both power systems and cybersecurity. In the plausible quantum world (Q-world), conventional approaches will likely face new challenges. The unique art of transmitting a quantum state from one place, Alice, to another, Bob, is known as quantum communication. Quantum communication for SCADA communication in a plausible quantum era thus obviously entails wired communication through optical fiber networks complying with the typical cybersecurity criteria of confidentiality, integrity, and availability for classical internet technology unless a quantum internet (qinternet) transpires practically. When combined with the reverse order of AIC for operational technology, the cybersecurity criteria for power networks' critical infrastructure drill down to more specific sub-areas. Unlike other communication modes, such as information technology (IT) in broadband internet connections, SCADA for power networks, one of the critical infrastructures, is intricately intertwined with operations technology (OT), which significantly increases complexity. Though it is desirable to have a barrier called a demilitarized zone (DMZ), some overlap is inevitable. This paper highlights the opportunities and challenges in securing SCADA communication in the plausible quantum computing and communication regime, along with a corresponding integrated Qiskit implementation for possible future framework development.",

      "abstract": "The Square Kilometre Array Telescope Manager (SKA TM) will be responsible for assisting the SKA Operations and Observation Management, carrying out System diagnosis and collecting Monitoring & Control data from the SKA sub-systems and components. To provide adequate compute resources, scalability, operation continuity and high availability, as well as strict Quality of Service, the TM cyber-infrastructure (embodied in the Local Infrastructure - LINFRA) consists of COTS hardware and infrastructural software (for example: server monitoring software, host operating system, virtualization software, device firmware), providing a specially tailored Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) solution. The TM infrastructure provides services in the form of computational power, software defined networking, power, storage abstractions, and high level, state of the art IaaS and PaaS management interfaces. This cyber platform will be tailored to each of the two SKA Phase 1 telescopes (SKA_MID in South Africa and SKA_LOW in Australia) instances, each presenting different computational and storage infrastructures and conditioned by location. This cyber platform will provide a compute model enabling TM to manage the deployment and execution of its multiple components (observation scheduler, proposal submission tools, M&C components, Forensic tools and several Databases, etc). In this sense, the TM LINFRA is primarily focused towards the provision of isolated instances, mostly resorting to virtualization technologies, while defaulting to bare hardware if specifically required due to performance, security, availability, or other requirement.",

      "abstract": "Concerns regarding privacy and data security in conventional healthcare prompted alternative technologies. In smart healthcare, blockchain technology addresses existing concerns with security, privacy, and electronic healthcare transmission. Integration of Blockchain Technology with the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) allows real-time monitoring of protected healthcare data. Utilizing edge devices with IoMT devices is very advantageous for addressing security, computing, and storage challenges. Encryption using symmetric and asymmetric keys is used to conceal sensitive information from unauthorized parties. SHA256 is an algorithm for one-way hashing. It is used to verify that the data has not been altered, since if it had, the hash value would have changed. This article offers a blockchain-based smart healthcare system using IoMT devices for continuous patient monitoring. In addition, it employs edge resources in addition to IoMT devices to have extra computing power and storage to hash and encrypt incoming data before sending it to the blockchain. Symmetric key is utilized to keep the data private even in the blockchain, allowing the patient to safely communicate the data through smart contracts while preventing unauthorized physicians from seeing the data. Through the use of a verification node and blockchain, an asymmetric key is used for the signing and validation of patient data in the healthcare provider system. In addition to other security measures, location-based authentication is recommended to guarantee that data originates from the patient area. Through the edge device, SHA256 is utilized to secure the data's integrity and a secret key is used to maintain its secrecy. The hChain architecture improves the computing power of IoMT environments, the security of EHR sharing through smart contracts, and the privacy and authentication procedures.",
