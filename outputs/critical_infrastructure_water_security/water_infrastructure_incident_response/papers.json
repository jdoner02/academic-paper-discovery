      "abstract": "In recent years, the adoption of cloud services has been expanding at an unprecedented rate. As more and more organizations migrate or deploy their businesses to the cloud, a multitude of related cybersecurity incidents such as data breaches are on the rise. Many inherent attributes of cloud environments, for example, data sharing, remote access, dynamicity and scalability, pose significant challenges for the protection of cloud security. Even worse, cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated and covert. Attack methods, such as Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), are continually developed to bypass traditional security measures. Among the emerging technologies for robust threat detection, system provenance analysis is being considered as a promising mechanism, thus attracting widespread attention in the field of incident response. This paper proposes a new few-shot learning-based attack detection with improved data context intelligence. We collect operating system behavior data of cloud systems during realistic attacks and leverage an innovative semiotics extraction method to describe system events. Inspired by the advances in semantic analysis, which is a fruitful area focused on understanding natural languages in computational linguistics, we further convert the anomaly detection problem into a similarity comparison problem. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed approach is able to generalize over unseen attacks and make accurate predictions, even if the incident detection models are trained with very limited samples.",

      "abstract": "Heat pumps (HPs) have emerged as a cost-effective and clean technology for sustainable energy systems, but their efficiency in producing hot water remains restricted by conventional threshold-based control methods. Although machine learning (ML) has been successfully implemented for various HP applications, optimization of household hot water demand forecasting remains understudied. This paper addresses this problem by introducing a novel approach that combines predictive ML with anomaly detection to create adaptive hot water production strategies based on household-specific consumption patterns. Our key contributions include: (1) a composite approach combining ML and isolation forest (iForest) to forecast household demand for hot water and steer responsive HP operations; (2) multi-step feature selection with advanced time-series analysis to capture complex usage patterns; (3) application and tuning of three ML models: Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Bi-directional LSTM with the self-attention mechanism on data from different types of real HP installations; and (4) experimental validation on six real household installations. Our experiments show that the best-performing model LightGBM achieves superior performance, with RMSE improvements of up to 9.37\\% compared to LSTM variants with $R^2$ values between 0.748-0.983. For anomaly detection, our iForest implementation achieved an F1-score of 0.87 with a false alarm rate of only 5.2\\%, demonstrating strong generalization capabilities across different household types and consumption patterns, making it suitable for real-world HP deployments.",

Training on live infrastructure poses significant risks to organizations, making secure, isolated cyber ranges an essential tool for conducting Red vs. Blue Team training events. These events enable security teams to refine their skills without impacting operational environments. While such training provides a strong foundation, the ever-evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates additional support for effective defense. To address this challenge, we introduce CyberAlly, a knowledge graph-enhanced AI assistant designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Blue Teams during incident response. Integrated into our cyber range alongside an open-source SIEM platform, CyberAlly monitors alerts, tracks Blue Team actions, and suggests tailored mitigation recommendations based on insights from prior Red vs. Blue Team exercises.

      "abstract": "A key countermeasure in cybersecurity has been the development of standardized computational protocols for modeling and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) between organizations, enabling a shared understanding of threats and coordinated global responses. However, while the cybersecurity domain benefits from mature threat exchange frameworks, there has been little progress in the automatic and interoperable sharing of knowledge about disinformation campaigns. This paper proposes an open-source disinformation threat intelligence framework for sharing interoperable disinformation incidents. This approach relies on i) the modeling of disinformation incidents with the DISARM framework (MITRE ATT&CK-based TTP modeling of disinformation attacks), ii) a custom mapping to STIX2 standard representation (computational data format), and iii) an exchange architecture (called DISINFOX) capable of using the proposed mapping with a centralized platform to store and manage disinformation incidents and CTI clients which consume the gathered incidents. The microservice-based implementation validates the framework with more than 100 real-world disinformation incidents modeled, stored, shared, and consumed successfully. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first academic and technical effort to integrate disinformation threats in the CTI ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Flooding is a major natural hazard causing significant fatalities and economic losses annually, with increasing frequency due to climate change. Rapid and accurate flood detection and monitoring are crucial for mitigating these impacts. This study compares the performance of three deep learning models UNet, ResNet, and DeepLabv3 for pixelwise water segmentation to aid in flood detection, utilizing images from drones, in field observations, and social media. This study involves creating a new dataset that augments wellknown benchmark datasets with flood-specific images, enhancing the robustness of the models. The UNet, ResNet, and DeepLab v3 architectures are tested to determine their effectiveness in various environmental conditions and geographical locations, and the strengths and limitations of each model are also discussed here, providing insights into their applicability in different scenarios by predicting image segmentation masks. This fully automated approach allows these models to isolate flooded areas in images, significantly reducing processing time compared to traditional semi-automated methods. The outcome of this study is to predict segmented masks for each image effected by a flood disaster and the validation accuracy of these models. This methodology facilitates timely and continuous flood monitoring, providing vital data for emergency response teams to reduce loss of life and economic damages. It offers a significant reduction in the time required to generate flood maps, cutting down the manual processing time. Additionally, we present avenues for future research, including the integration of multimodal data sources and the development of robust deep learning architectures tailored specifically for flood detection tasks. Overall, our work contributes to the advancement of flood management strategies through innovative use of deep learning technologies.",

Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing empower these chatbots to handle user inquiries and deliver threat intelligence. This helps cyber security knowledge readily available to both professionals and the public. Traditional rule-based chatbots often lack flexibility and struggle to adapt to user interactions. In contrast, Large Language Model-based chatbots offer contextually relevant information across multiple domains and adapt to evolving conversational contexts. In this work, we develop IntellBot, an advanced cyber security Chatbot built on top of cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models and Langchain alongside a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to deliver superior capabilities. This chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and emerging threats. It delivers tailored responses, serving as a primary hub for cyber security insights. By providing instant access to relevant information and resources, this IntellBot enhances threat intelligence, incident response, and overall security posture, saving time and empowering users with knowledge of cyber security best practices. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of our copilot using a two-stage evaluation strategy. We achieved BERT score above 0.8 by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which affirms the accuracy of our copilot. Additionally, we utilized RAGAS to evaluate the RAG model, and all evaluation metrics consistently produced scores above 0.77, highlighting the efficacy of our system.",

These patterns can be scheduled, such as daily residential irrigation, or unexpected, such as demand spikes from withdrawals for fire management. The critical necessity of clean, safe, and reliable water requires water treatment control strategies that are insensitive to disturbances to guarantee that demand will be met. One essential problem in achieving this is the minimization of energy costs in the process of meeting water demand, especially as the need for decarbonization persists. This work develops a control-oriented hydraulic model of a water treatment facility with integrated pumped storage and introduces a model predictive control strategy for scheduling treatment plant system operations to minimize greenhouse gas emissions and safely meet water demand.",

      "abstract": "Water is routinely exposed to external electric fields (EFs). Whether, e.g., at physiological conditions, in contact with biological systems, or at the interface of polar surfaces in countless technological and industrial settings, water responds to EFs on the order of a few V/{\\AA} in a manner that is still under intense investigation. Dating back to the $19^{th}$ century, the possibility of solidifying water upon applying an EF instead of adjusting temperature and pressure -- a process known as electrofreezing -- is an alluring promise that has canalized major efforts since, with uncertain outcomes. In this work, we perform long \\emph{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations \\textcolor{black}{of water at ambient conditions exposed at EFs of different intensities. While the response of single water molecules is almost instantaneous, the cooperativity of the hydrogen bonds induces slower reorganizations that can be captured by dividing the trajectories in disjoint time windows and by performing analysis on each of them separately. Upon adopting this approach, we find} that EFs of $0.10\\leq$EFs$\\leq0.15$~V/{\\AA} induce electrofreezing \\textcolor{black}{occurring after $\\sim150$~ps. We observe a continuous transition to a disordered state characterized by frozen dynamical properties, damped oscillations, lower energy, and enhanced local structural properties. Therefore, we ascribe this state to} a new ferroelectric amorphous phase, which we term f-GW (ferroelectric glassy water). Our work represents the first evidence of electrofreezing of liquid water at ambient conditions and therefore impacts several fields, from \\textcolor{black}{fundamental chemical physics to} biology \\textcolor{black}{and} catalysis.",

Operating failures in these systems can cause serious risks for society. To avoid or minimize downtime, operators require real-time awareness about critical incidents. However, online event identification in CPSs is challenged by the complex interdependency of numerous physical and digital components, requiring to take cyber attacks and physical failures equally into account. The online event identification problem is further complicated through the lack of historical observations of critical but rare events, and the continuous evolution of cyber attack strategies. This work introduces and demonstrates CyPhERS, a Cyber-Physical Event Reasoning System. CyPhERS provides real-time information pertaining the occurrence, location, physical impact, and root cause of potentially critical events in CPSs, without the need for historical event observations. Key novelty of CyPhERS is the capability to generate informative and interpretable event signatures of known and unknown types of both cyber attacks and physical failures. The concept is evaluated and benchmarked on a demonstration case that comprises a multitude of attack and fault events targeting various components of a CPS. The results demonstrate that the event signatures provide relevant and inferable information on both known and unknown event types.",

An AICA based on the ideas of Self-Adaptive Autonomic Computing Systems (SA-ACS) can be considered as a managing system that protects a managed system like a personal computer, web application, critical infrastructure, etc. An AICA, specifically the IRS components, can compute a wide range of potential responses to meet its security goals and objectives, such as taking actions to prevent the attack from completing, restoring the system to comply with the organizational security policy, containing or confining an attack, attack eradication, deploying forensics measures to enable future attack analysis, counterattack, and so on. To restrict its activities in order to minimize collateral/organizational damage, such an automated system must have set Rules of Engagement (RoE). Automated systems must determine which operations can be completely automated (and when), which actions require human operator confirmation, and which actions must never be undertaken. In this paper, to enable this control functionality over an IRS, we create Rules of EngaGement for Automated cybeR Defense (REGARD) system which holds a set of Rules of Engagement (RoE) to protect the managed system according to the instructions provided by the human operator. These rules help limit the action of the IRS on the managed system in compliance with the recommendations of the domain expert. We provide details of execution, management, operation, and conflict resolution for Rules of Engagement (RoE) to constrain the actions of an automated IRS. We also describe REGARD system implementation, security case studies for cyber defense, and RoE demonstrations.",

To better understand and explain the clustering results derived from the machine learning process, we further applied a decision tree analysis algorithm to associate the input data with the derived clusters, to identify and rank the importance of factors that characterize different water access conditions in each cluster. Our results complement experts' priority rankings of water infrastructure needs, providing a more in-depth view of the water insecurity challenges that the Colonias suffer from. As an automated and reproducible workflow combining a series of tools, the proposed machine learning pipeline represents an operationalized solution for conducting data-driven analysis to understand water access inequality. This pipeline can be adapted to analyze different datasets and decision scenarios.",

      "abstract": "A major outage in the electricity distribution system may affect the operation of water and natural gas supply systems, leading to an interruption of multiple services to critical customers. Therefore, enhancing resilience of critical infrastructures requires joint efforts of multiple sectors. In this paper, a distribution system service restoration method considering the electricity-water-gas interdependency is proposed. The objective is to provide electricity, water, and natural gas supplies to critical customers in the desired ratio according to their needs after an extreme event. The operational constraints of electricity, water, and natural gas networks are considered. The characteristics of electricity-driven coupling components, including water pumps and gas compressors, are also modeled. Relaxation techniques are applied to nonconvex constraints posed by physical laws of those networks. Consequently, the restoration problem is formulated as a mixed-integer second-order cone program, which can readily be solved by the off-the-shelf solvers. The proposed method is validated by numerical simulations on electricity-water-gas integrated systems, developed based on benchmark models of the subsystems. The results indicate that considering the interdependency refines the allocation of limited generation resources and demonstrate the exactness of the proposed convex relaxation.",

      "abstract": "Due to the critical importance of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) to the operations of cities and countries, research into the security of critical infrastructure has become increasingly relevant and necessary. As a component of both the research and application sides of smart city development, accurate and precise modeling, simulation, and verification are key parts of a robust design and development tools that provide critical assistance in the prevention, detection, and recovery from abnormal behavior in the sensors, controllers, and actuators which make up a modern ICS system. However, while these tools have potential, there is currently a need for helper-tools to assist with their setup and configuration, if they are to be utilized widely. Existing state-of-the-art tools are often technically complex and difficult to customize for any given IoT/ICS processes. This is a serious barrier to entry for most technicians, engineers, researchers, and smart city planners, while slowing down the critical aspects of safety and security verification. To remedy this issue, we take a case study of existing simulation toolkits within the field of water management and expand on existing tools and algorithms with simplistic automated retrieval functionality using a much more in-depth and usable customization interface to accelerate simulation scenario design and implementation, allowing for customization of the cyber-physical network infrastructure and cyber attack scenarios. We additionally provide a novel in-tool-assessment of network's resilience according to graph theory path diversity. Further, we lay out a roadmap for future development and application of the proposed tool, including expansions on resiliency and potential vulnerability model checking, and discuss applications of our work to other fields relevant to the design and operation of smart cities.",

The incidents in the WDS cause leak and water loss, which imposes pressure gradient and public health crisis. Hence, utility managers need to assess the condition of pipelines periodically and localize the leak location (in case it is reported). In our previous works, we designed and developed a size-adaptable modular in-pipe robot [1] and controlled its motion in in-service WDS. However, due to the linearization of the dynamical equations of the robot, the stabilizer controller which is a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) cannot stabilize the large deviations of the stabilizing states due to the presence of obstacles that fails the robot during operation. To this aim, we design a self-rescue mechanism for the robot in which three auxiliary gear-motors retract and extend the arm modules with the designed controller towards a reliable motion in the negotiation of large obstacles and non-straight configurations. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism along with the motion controller enables the robot to have an improved motion in pipelines.",

However, pipelines are long and access to all parts of it is a chal-lenging task; current in-pipe robots have the limitations of short-distance inspection and inability to operate in-service networks. In this work, we improve the design of our previously developed in-pipe robot and analyze the effect of line pressure and relative velocity on the robot during operation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. An extreme scenario for robot operation is defined and we estimate the minimum inspection distance for the robot with one turn of battery charge that is 5400m. A multi-phase motion controller is proposed that ensures reliable motion at straight and non-straight configurations of pipeline and also stabilized configuration with zero velocity at junctions. We also propose a localization and navigation method based on particle filtering and combine it with the proposed multi-phase motion controller. In this method, the map of the operation is provided to the robot and the robot localizes itself based on the map and the particle filtering method. Furthermore, the robot navigates different configurations of pipelines by switching between different phases of the motion controller algorithm that is performed by the particle filter algorithm. The experiment and simulation results show that the robot along with the navigation shows a promising solution towards long-distance inspection of pipelines by in-pipe robots.",

The effects include damages to the pipes, flash floods on the streets and combined sewer overflows. Retrofitting underground infrastructure is very expensive, thus water infrastructure operators are increasingly looking to deploy IoT solutions that promise to alleviate the problems at a fraction of the cost. In this paper, we report on preliminary results from an ongoing joint research project, specifically on the design and evaluation of its data analytics platform. The overall system consists of energy-efficient sensor nodes that send their observations to a stream processing engine, which analyzes and enriches the data and transmits the results to a GIS-based frontend. As the proposed solution is designed to monitor large and critical infrastructures of cities, several non-functional requirements such as scalability, responsiveness and dependability are factored into the system architecture. We present a scalable stream processing platform and its integration with the other components, as well as the algorithms used for data processing. We discuss significant challenges and design decisions, introduce an efficient data enrichment procedure and present empirical results to validate the compliance with the target requirements. The entire code for deploying our platform and running the data enrichment jobs is made publicly available with this paper.",

Thus, security incidents targeting CPSs can have disruptive consequences to assets and people. As prior incidents tend to re-occur, sharing knowledge about these incidents can help organizations be more prepared to prevent, mitigate or investigate future incidents. This paper proposes a novel approach to enable representation and sharing of knowledge about CPS incidents across different organizations. To support sharing, we represent incident knowledge (incident patterns) capturing incident characteristics that can manifest again, such as incident activities or vulnerabilities exploited by offenders. Incident patterns are a more abstract representation of specific incident instances and, thus, are general enough to be applicable to various systems - different than the one in which the incident occurred. They can also avoid disclosing potentially sensitive information about an organization's assets and resources. We provide an automated technique to extract an incident pattern from a specific incident instance. To understand how an incident pattern can manifest again in other cyber-physical systems, we also provide an automated technique to instantiate incident patterns to specific systems. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in the application domain of smart buildings. We evaluate correctness, scalability, and performance using two substantive scenarios inspired by real-world systems and incidents.",

      "abstract": "Cities are the drivers of socio-economic innovation, and are also forced to address the accelerating risk of failure in providing essential services such as water supply today and in the future. Here, we investigate the resilience of urban water supply security, which is defined in terms of the services that citizens receive. The resilience of services is determined by the availability and robustness of critical system elements, or 'capitals' (water resources, infrastructure, finances, management efficacy and community adaptation). We translate quantitative information about this portfolio of capitals from seven contrasting cities on four continents into parameters of a coupled systems dynamics model. Water services are disrupted by recurring stochastic shocks, and we simulate the dynamics of impact and recovery cycles. Resilience emerges under various constraints, expressed in terms of each city's capital portfolio. Systematic assessment of the parameter space produces the urban water resilience landscape, and we determine the position of each city along a continuous gradient from water insecure and non-resilient to secure and resilient systems. In several cities stochastic disturbance regimes challenge steady-state conditions and drive system collapse. While water insecure and non-resilient cities risk being pushed into a poverty trap, cities which have developed excess capitals risk being trapped in rigidity and crossing a tipping point from high to low services and collapse. Where public services are insufficient, community adaptation improves water security and resilience to varying degrees. Our results highlight the need for resilience thinking in the governance of urban water systems under global change pressures.",

However, having an accurate anomaly detection system is not an easy task, due to the difficulty to differentiate between cyber-attacks and system internal failures (e.g. hardware failures). In this paper, we present a model that detects anomaly events in a water system controlled by SCADA. Six Machine Learning techniques have been used in building and evaluating the model. The model classifies different anomaly events including hardware failures (e.g. sensor failures), sabotage and cyber-attacks (e.g. DoS and Spoofing). Unlike other detection systems, our proposed work focuses on notifying the operator when an anomaly occurs with a probability of the event occurring. This additional information helps in accelerating the mitigation process. The model is trained and tested using a real-world dataset.",

The case heat recovery system was found to provide significant greenhouse gas emission reductions (up to 75%) and limited primary energy savings (around 30%). These limited savings are found to be mainly due to the performance of the heat pump system. Three emergency cold recovery techniques are presented as a response to heat-waves: subway station cooling, ice production for individual cooling, and \"heat-wave shelter\" cooling in association with pavement-watering. The cold generation potential of each approach is assessed with a special consideration for mains water temperature sanitary limitations.

The proposed study is of much relevance to efficient solar energy utilization.",

      "abstract": "In the event that a bacteriological or chemical toxin is intro- duced to a water distribution network, a large population of consumers may become exposed to the contaminant. A contamination event may be poorly predictable dynamic process due to the interactions of consumers and utility managers during an event. Consumers that become aware of a threat may select protective actions that change their water demands from typical demand patterns, and new hydraulic conditions can arise that differ from conditions that are predicted when demands are considered as exogenous inputs. Consequently, the movement of the contaminant plume in the pipe network may shift from its expected trajectory. A sociotechnical model is developed here to integrate agent-based models of consumers with an engineering water distribution system model and capture the dynamics between consumer behaviors and the water distribution system for predicting contaminant transport and public exposure. Consumers are simulated as agents with behaviors defined for water use activities, mobility, word-of-mouth communication, and demand reduction, based on a set of rules representing an agents autonomy and reaction to health impacts, the environment, and the actions of other agents. As consumers decrease their water use, the demand exerted on the water distribution system is updated; as the flow directions and volumes shift in response, the location of the contaminant plume is updated and the amount of contaminant consumed by each agent is calculated. The framework is tested through simulating realistic contamination scenarios for a virtual city and water distribution system.",

      "abstract": "A computer network can be attacked in a number of ways. The security-related threats have become not only numerous but also diverse and they may also come in the form of blended attacks. It becomes difficult for any security system to block all types of attacks. This gives rise to the need of an incidence handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited and restoring the computing services. Incidence response has always been an important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will handle the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.",
