Mutually mistrustful Alice and Bob are able to agree and sign a series of documents in a way that makes it impossible (within the assumed security model) to repudiate their signatures. The number of signatures supported by a single public key is limited by a large number but the security of the signature scheme is not diminished by repeated application. A single public key supports both parties. Some ramifications are discussed, security parameters evaluated and an application area delineated for the proposed concept.",

      "abstract": "As quantum computing technology matures, it poses a threat to the security of mainstream asymmetric cryptographic methods. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology released the final version of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithm standards in August 2024. These post-quantum cryptographic algorithms are primarily based on lattice-based and hash-based cryptography. Therefore, this study proposes the Post-Quantum Cryptography Winternitz-Chen (PQCWC) anonymous scheme, aimed at exploring the design of anonymous schemes based on PQC for future applications in privacy protection. The anonymous scheme designed in this study is mainly built on the Winternitz signature scheme, which can prevent the original public key from being exposed in the certificate. Furthermore, the PQCWC anonymous scheme integrates the butterfly key expansion mechanism, proposing the first hash-based butterfly key expansion mechanism in the world, achieving anonymity for both the registration authority and the certificate authority, thereby fully protecting privacy. In the experimental environment, this study compares various hash algorithms, including Secure Hash Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), the SHA-2 series, the SHA-3 series, and the BLAKE series. The results demonstrate that the proposed anonymous scheme can achieve anonymity without increasing key length, signature length, key generation time, signature generation time, or signature verification time.",

      "abstract": "Forward-secure signatures guarantee that the signatures generated before the compromise of private key remain secure, and therefore offer an enhanced compromise-resiliency for real-life applications such as digital forensics, audit logs, and financial systems. However, the vast majority of state-of-the-art forward-secure signatures rely on conventional intractability assumptions and therefore are not secure against quantum computers. Hash-based signatures (HBS) (e.g., XMSS) can offer forward-secure post-quantum security. However, they are efficient only for a pre-defined number of messages to be signed and incur high key generation overhead, highly expensive signing, and large signature sizes for an increasing number of messages. It is an open problem to develop quantum-safe forward-secure signatures that are efficient and practical with a signing capability scalable to their security parameters.   In this work, we propose a new series of post-quantum signatures that we call FROG (Forward-secuRe pOst-quantum siGnature). Unlike HBS alternatives, FROG can achieve highly computational efficient signatures with sub-linear key/signature sizes and (practically) unbounded signing capability. This is achieved by transforming suitable post-quantum signatures into forward-secure settings via MMM constructions. We investigated the transformation of prominent post-quantum secure signatures such as Dilithium, WOTS, and BLISS with MMM. Our experiments indicate that FROG outperforms XMSS for the vast majority (if not all for a large number of messages) of performance metrics. We also discuss one-time variants of these base signature schemes that can push the performance of FROG to the edge. Overall, FROG shows a better performance than the existing alternatives with forward-security and therefore is an ideal alternative for the standardization efforts for forward-secure post-quantum signatures.",

      "abstract": "This work revisits the security of classical signatures and ring signatures in a quantum world. For (ordinary) signatures, we focus on the arguably preferable security notion of blind-unforgeability recently proposed by Alagic et al. (Eurocrypt'20). We present two short signature schemes achieving this notion: one is in the quantum random oracle model, assuming quantum hardness of SIS; and the other is in the plain model, assuming quantum hardness of LWE with super-polynomial modulus. Prior to this work, the only known blind-unforgeable schemes are Lamport's one-time signature and the Winternitz one-time signature, and both of them are in the quantum random oracle model.   For ring signatures, the recent work by Chatterjee et al. (Crypto'21) proposes a definition trying to capture adversaries with quantum access to the signer. However, it is unclear if their definition, when restricted to the classical world, is as strong as the standard security notion for ring signatures. They also present a construction that only partially achieves (even) this seeming weak definition, in the sense that the adversary can only conduct superposition attacks over the messages, but not the rings. We propose a new definition that does not suffer from the above issue. Our definition is an analog to the blind-unforgeability in the ring signature setting. Moreover, assuming the quantum hardness of LWE, we construct a compiler converting any blind-unforgeable (ordinary) signatures to a ring signature satisfying our definition.",

      "abstract": "Post-quantum security is critical in the quantum era. Quantum computers, along with quantum algorithms, make the standard cryptography based on RSA or ECDSA over FL or Blockchain vulnerable. The implementation of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) over such systems is poorly understood as PQC is still in its standardization phase. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ PQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple factors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a verifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed method and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security and performance aspects of BFL systems.",

We define a notion of security for quotable signature schemes and construct a concrete example of a quotable signature scheme, using Merkle trees and classical digital signature schemes. The scheme is shown to be secure, with respect to the aforementioned notion of security. Additionally, we prove bounds on the complexity of the constructed scheme and provide algorithms for signing, quoting, and verifying. Finally, concrete use cases of quotable signatures are considered, using them to combat misinformation by bolstering authentic content on social media. We consider both how quotable signatures can be used, and why using them could help mitigate the effects of fake news.",

In this paper, we present two arbitrated quantum signature schemes without utilizing entangled states in the signing phase and the verifying phase. The first proposed scheme can preserve the merits in the existing schemes. Then, we point out, in this scheme and the prior schemes, there exists a problem that Bob can repudiate the integrality of the signatures. To conquer this problem, we construct another arbitrated quantum signature scheme without using quantum entangled states but using a public board. The new scheme has three advantages: it does not utilize entangled states while it can preserve all merits in the existing schemes; the integrality of the signature can avoid being disavowed by the receiver; and, it provides a higher efficiency in transmission and reduces the complexity of implementation. Furthermore, we present a technique such that the quantum message can keep secret to the arbitrator in a arbitrated quantum signature scheme.",

      "abstract": "We study digital signatures with revocation capabilities and show two results. First, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signing keys from the LWE assumption. In this primitive, the signing key is a quantum state which enables a user to sign many messages and yet, the quantum key is also revocable, i.e., it can be collapsed into a classical certificate which can later be verified. Once the key is successfully revoked, we require that the initial recipient of the key loses the ability to sign. We construct digital signatures with revocable signing keys from a newly introduced primitive which we call two-tier one-shot signatures, which may be of independent interest. This is a variant of one-shot signatures, where the verification of a signature for the message ``0'' is done publicly, whereas the verification for the message ``1'' is done in private. We give a construction of two-tier one-shot signatures from the LWE assumption. As a complementary result, we also construct digital signatures with quantum revocation from group actions, where the quantum signing key is simply ``returned'' and then verified as part of revocation.   Second, we define and construct digital signatures with revocable signatures from OWFs. In this primitive, the signer can produce quantum signatures which can later be revoked. Here, the security property requires that, once revocation is successful, the initial recipient of the signature loses the ability to find accepting inputs to the signature verification algorithm. We construct this primitive using a newly introduced two-tier variant of tokenized signatures. For the construction, we show a new lemma which we call the adaptive hardcore bit property for OWFs, which may enable further applications.",

Here we prove that with properly adjusted parameters Lamport and Winternitz one-time signatures schemes could exhibit a forgery detection availability property. This property is of significant importance in the framework of crypto-agility paradigm since the considered forgery detection serves as an alarm that the employed cryptographic hash function becomes insecure to use and the corresponding scheme has to be replaced.",

To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a modification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, (2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new enhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a fraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for proving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts.

Signature Theorem and its Inverse guarantee any application of differential invariant signature curves to the invariant recognition of visual objects. We first show the invalidity of Curvature-inverse and Signature inverse theorems, meaning non-congruent meshes may have the same joint invariant numerical curvature or signature. Then by classifying three and five point ordinary meshes respectively in the Euclidean and affine cases, we look for conditions in terms of the associated joint invariant signatures which make these theorems correct. Additionally, we bring forward The Host Theorem to provide a simpler version of Signature-inverse Theorem for closed ordinary meshes.",

In this paper we continue our study, showing that the signature index class is invariant under rational Witt bordisms and stratified homotopies. We are also able to identify this analytic class with the topological analogue of the Mischenko symmetric signature recently defined by Banagl.

Building on previous work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected signatures, in a general semimartingale setting.

However, BLS aggregate signatures are difficult to use correctly, with nuanced requirements that must be carefully handled by protocol developers.   In this work, we design the first models of aggregate signatures that enable formal verification tools, such as Tamarin and ProVerif, to be applied to protocols using these signatures. We introduce general models that are based on the cryptographic security definition of generic aggregate signatures, allowing the attacker to exploit protocols where the security requirements are not satisfied. We also introduce a second family of models formalizing BLS aggregate signatures in particular. We demonstrate our approach's practical relevance by modelling and analyzing in Tamarin a device attestation protocol called SANA. Despite SANA's claimed correctness proof, with Tamarin we uncover undocumented assumptions that, when omitted, lead to attacks.",

Digital signatures have revolutionized Internet-scale applications, but current signatures are too slow for the growing genre of microsecond-scale systems in modern data centers. We propose DSig, the first digital signature system to achieve single-digit microsecond latency to sign, transmit, and verify signatures in data center systems. DSig is based on the observation that, in many data center applications, the signer of a message knows most of the time who will verify its signature. We introduce a new hybrid signature scheme that combines cheap single-use hash-based signatures verified in the foreground with traditional signatures pre-verified in the background. Compared to prior state-of-the-art signatures, DSig reduces signing time from 18.9 to 0.7 us and verification time from 35.6 to 5.1 us, while keeping signature transmission time below 2.5 us. Moreover, DSig achieves 2.5x higher signing throughput and 6.9x higher verification throughput than the state of the art. We use DSig to (a) bring auditability to two key-value stores (HERD and Redis) and a financial trading system (based on Liquibook) for 86% lower added latency than the state of the art, and (b) replace signatures in BFT broadcast and BFT replication, reducing their latency by 73% and 69%, respectively",

It has been widely accepted that traditional file signatures are inferior alternatives to inverted files. This paper describes TopSig, a new approach to the construction of file signatures. Many advances in semantic hashing and dimensionality reduction have been made in recent times, but these were not so far linked to general purpose, signature file based, search engines. This paper introduces a different signature file approach that builds upon and extends these recent advances. We are able to demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of signature file based indexing and retrieval, performance that is comparable to that of state of the art inverted file based systems, including Language models and BM25. These findings suggest that file signatures offer a viable alternative to inverted files in suitable settings and from the theoretical perspective it positions the file signatures model in the class of Vector Space retrieval models.",

Wall showed that this property is not true of signatures on manifolds with boundary and that the difference from additivity could be described as a certain Maslov triple index. Perverse signatures are signatures defined for any stratified pseudomanifold, using the intersection homology groups of Goresky and MacPherson. In the case of Witt spaces, the middle perverse signature is the same as the Witt signature. This paper proves a generalization to perverse signatures of Wall's non-additivity theorem for signatures of manifolds with boundary. Under certain topological conditions on the dividing hypersurface,Novikov additivity for perverse signatures may be deduced as a corollary. In particular, Siegel's version of Novikov additivity for Witt signatures is a special case of this corollary.",

However, the performance of the system highly relies on the quality of the signatures designed to detect attacks. A weak signature set may considerably cause an increase in false alarm rate, making impractical to deploy the system. The objective of the paper is to identify the flaws in the signature structure which are responsible to reduce the efficiency of the detection system. The paper targets SQL injection signatures particularly. Initially, some essential concepts of the domain of the attack that should be focused by the developer in prior to designing the signatures have been discussed. Afterwards, we conducted a case study on the well known PHPIDS tool for analyzing the quality of its SQL signatures. Based on the analysis, we identify various flaws in the designing practice that yield inefficient signatures. We divide the weak signatures into six categories, namely incomplete, irrelevant, semi-relevant, susceptible, redundant and inconsistent signatures. Moreover, we quantify these weaknesses and define them mathematically in terms of set theory. To the best of our knowledge, we have identified some novel signature design issues. The paper will basically assist the signature developer to know what level of expertise is required for devising a quality signature set and how a little ignorance may lead to deterioration in the performance of the SIDS. Furthermore, a security expert may evaluate the detector against the identified flaws by conducting structural analysis on its signature set.",

The scenario we explore consists of a set of signatures, which could be signed by the same author or by multiple signers. As such, we discuss three methods which estimate automatically the common authorship of a set of off-line signatures. The first method develops a score similarity matrix, worked out with the assistance of duplicated signatures; the second uses a feature-distance matrix for each pair of signatures; and the last method introduces pre-classification based on the complexity of each signature. Publicly available signatures were used in the experiments, which gave encouraging results. As a baseline for the performance obtained by our approaches, we carried out a visual Turing Test where forensic and non-forensic human volunteers, carrying out the same task, performed less well than the automatic schemes.",

Compared with the other public datasets, UTSig has more samples, more classes, and more forgers. We considered various variables including signing period, writing instrument, signature box size, and number of observable samples for forgers in the data collection procedure. By careful examination of main characteristics of offline signature datasets, we observe that Persian signatures have fewer numbers of branch points and end points. We propose and evaluate four different training and test setups for UTSig. Results of our experiments show that training genuine samples along with opposite-hand samples and random forgeries can improve the performance in terms of equal error rate and minimum cost of log likelihood ratio.",

Several libraries are there that implement identity-based cryptosystems that include identity-based signature schemes like the JPBC library which is written in Java and the charm-crypto library written in python. However, these libraries do not contain all of the popular schemes, rather the JPBC library contains only one identity-based signature scheme and the charm-crypto contains three. Furthermore, the implemented schemes are designed to work on one particular pairing curve. In pairing-based cryptosystems, even for a given signature scheme, the size of the signature and the performance i.e. the time to sign and verify depends on the chosen pairing curve. There are many applications in which the signature size is of more importance than the performance and similarly other applications where the performance is of more importance than signature size. In this work, we describe the popular signature schemes and their implementation using the JPBC library and describe how different pairing curves affect the signature size and performance. We also provide two methods to further shorten the signature size which is not present in the libraries by default.",

However, in most redactable signature schemes, to remove parts of the signed message, we need pieces of information for each part we want to remove. If a signed message consists of l elements, the number of elements in an original signature is at least linear in l. As far as we know, in some redactable signature schemes, the number of elements in an original signature is constant, regardless of the number of elements in a message to be signed. However, these constructions have drawbacks in that the use of the random oracle model or generic group model. In this paper, we construct an efficient redactable signature to overcome these drawbacks. Our redactable signature is obtained by combining set-commitment proposed in the recent work by Fuchsbauer et al. (JoC 2019) and digital signatures.",

      "abstract": "Offline handwritten signature verification systems are used to verify the identity of individuals, through recognizing their handwritten signature image as genuine signatures or forgeries. The main tasks of signature verification systems include extracting features from signature images and training a classifier for classification. The challenges of these tasks are twofold. First, genuine signatures and skilled forgeries are highly similar in their appearances, resulting in a small inter-class distance. Second, the instances of skilled forgeries are often unavailable, when signature verification models are being trained. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes a new signature verification method. It is the first model that employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract features directly from signature images. To make the features more discriminative, it improves the traditional VAEs by introducing a new loss function for feature disentangling. In addition, it relies on SVM (Support Vector Machine) for classification according to the extracted features. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets: MCYT-75 and GPDS-synthetic where the proposed method significantly outperformed $13$ representative offline signature verification methods. The achieved improvement in distinctive datasets indicates the robustness and great potential of the developed system in real application.",

      "abstract": "On the basis of the signatures scheme without trapdoors from lattice, which is proposed by Vadim Lyubashevsky in 2012, we present a new ring signature scheme from lattice. The proposed ring signature scheme is an extension of the signatures scheme without trapdoors. We proved that our scheme is strongly unforgeable against adaptive chosen message in the random oracle model, and proved that the security of our scheme can be reduced to the hardness of the small integer solution (SIS) problem by rejection samplings. Compared with the existing lattice-based ring signature schemes, our new scheme is more efficient and with shorter signature length.",
