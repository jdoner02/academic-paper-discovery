      "abstract": "Municipalities are vulnerable to cyberattacks with devastating consequences, but they lack key information to evaluate their own risk and compare their security posture to peers. Using data from 83 municipalities collected via a cryptographically secure computation platform about their security posture, incidents, security control failures, and losses, we build data-driven cyber risk models and cyber security benchmarks for municipalities. We produce benchmarks of the security posture in a sector, the frequency of cyber incidents, forecasted annual losses for organizations based on their defensive posture, and a weighting of cyber controls based on their individual failure rates and associated losses. Combined, these four items can help guide cyber policymaking by quantifying the cyber risk in a sector, identifying gaps that need to be addressed, prioritizing policy interventions, and tracking progress of those interventions over time. In the case of the municipalities, these newly derived risk measures highlight the need for continuous measured improvement of cybersecurity readiness, show clear areas of weakness and strength, and provide governments with some early targets for policy focus such as security education, incident response, and focusing efforts first on municipalities at the lowest security levels that have the highest risk reduction per security dollar invested.",

      "abstract": "As machine learning becomes a more mainstream technology, the objective for governments and public sectors is to harness the power of machine learning to advance their mission by revolutionizing public services. Motivational government use cases require special considerations for implementation given the significance of the services they provide. Not only will these applications be deployed in a potentially hostile environment that necessitates protective mechanisms, but they are also subject to government transparency and accountability initiatives which further complicates such protections.   In this paper, we describe how the inevitable interactions between a user of unknown trustworthiness and the machine learning models, deployed in governments and public sectors, can jeopardize the system in two major ways: by compromising the integrity or by violating the privacy. We then briefly overview the possible attacks and defense scenarios, and finally, propose recommendations and guidelines that once considered can enhance the security and privacy of the provided services.",

      "abstract": "In todays increasingly digital world, data has become one of the most valuable assets for organizations. With the rise in cyberattacks, data breaches, and the stringent regulatory environment, it is imperative to adopt robust data protection strategies. One such approach is the use of governance frameworks, which provide structured guidelines, policies, and processes to ensure data protection, compliance, and ethical usage. This paper explores the role of data governance frameworks in protecting sensitive information and maintaining organizational data security. It delves into the principles, strategies, and best practices that constitute an effective governance framework, including risk management, access controls, data quality assurance, and compliance with regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. By analyzing case studies from various sectors, the paper highlights the practicalchallenges, limitations, and advantages of implementing data governance frameworks. Additionally, the paper examines how data governance frameworks contribute to transparency, accountability, and operational efficiency, while also identifying emerging trends and technologies that enhance data protection. Ultimately, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how governance frameworks can be leveraged to safeguard organizational data and ensure its responsible use.",

      "abstract": "Digital public services have revolutionised citizen and private sector interactions with governments. Certain communities are strongly dependent on such digital services for ensuring the availability of public services due to geographical isolation or the presence of adverse geophysical and weather phenomena. However, strong and effective security is key to maintaining the integrity of public records and services yet also for ensuring trust in them. Trust is essential for user uptake, particularly given a global increase in data-protection concerns and a turbulent geopolitical security environment. In this paper, we examine the case of public trust in various forms of authentication for electronic identification in Iceland, which has high availability requirements for digital public services due to its unique and dynamic geophysical characteristics. Additionally, Iceland has historically low levels of institutional trust which may conflict with the requirement for an increased need for digital public services. Through surveying the Icelandic general public, we find that there is a high-level of trust in digital identification services across all demographics. We conclude with a discussion and future research challenges towards improving the effectiveness of authentication considering the diverse groups within Icelandic society, such as the rapidly increasing population of migrants and the large and dynamic population of tourists.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity governance influences the quality of strategic decision-making to ensure cyber risks are managed effectively. Board of Directors are the decisions-makers held accountable for managing this risk; however, they lack adequate and efficient information necessary for making such decisions. In addition to the myriad of challenges they face, they are often insufficiently versed in the technology or cybersecurity terminology or not provided with the correct tools to support them to make sound decisions to govern cybersecurity effectively. A different approach is needed to ensure BoDs are clear on the approach the business is taking to build a cyber resilient organization. This systematic literature review investigates the existing risk measurement instruments, cybersecurity metrics, and associated models for supporting BoDs. We identified seven conceptual themes through literature analysis that form the basis of this study's main contribution. The findings showed that, although sophisticated cybersecurity tools exist and are developing, there is limited information for Board of Directors to support them in terms of metrics and models to govern cybersecurity in a language they understand. The review also provides some recommendations on theories and models that can be further investigated to provide support to Board of Directors.",

In this paper, we try to develop a secure information sharing approach for digital government to improve home land security. This approach is a role and cooperation based approach for security personnel of different government departments. In order to run any successful digital government of any country in the world, it is necessary to interact with their citizen and to share secure information via different network among the citizen or other government. Consequently, in order to smooth the progress of users to cooperate with and share information without darkness and flawlessly transversely different networks and databases universally, a safe and trusted information-sharing environment has been renowned as a very important requirement and to press forward homeland security endeavor. The key incentive following this research is to put up a secure and trusted information-sharing approach for government departments. This paper presents a proficient function and teamwork based information sharing approach for safe exchange of hush-hush and privileged information amid security personnels and government departments inside the national boundaries by means of public key cryptography. The expanded approach makes use of cryptographic hash function; public key cryptosystem and a unique and complex mapping function for securely swapping over secret information. Moreover, the projected approach facilitates privacy preserving information sharing with probable restrictions based on the rank of the security personnels.",

      "abstract": "The availability of public services through online platforms has improved the coverage and efficiency of essential services provided to citizens worldwide. These services also promote transparency and foster citizen participation in government processes. However, the increased online presence also exposes sensitive data exchanged between citizens and service providers to a wider range of security threats. Therefore, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of online services is crucial to Electronic Government (EGOV) initiatives' success. Hence, this work assesses the security posture of online platforms hosted in 3068 governmental domain names, across all UN Member States, in three dimensions: support for secure communication protocols; the trustworthiness of their digital certificate chains; and services' exposure to known vulnerabilities. The results indicate that despite its rapid development, the public sector still falls short in adopting international standards and best security practices in services and infrastructure management. This reality poses significant risks to citizens and services across all regions and income levels.",

Here, Floridi considers the positive impact of these municipal AI registers, which collect a limited number of algorithmic systems used by the city of Amsterdam and Helsinki. There are a number of assumptions about AI registers as a governance model for automated systems that we seek to question. Starting with recent attempts to normalize AI by decontextualizing and depoliticizing it, which is a fraught political project that encourages what we call 'ethics theater' given the proven dangers of using these systems in the context of the digital welfare state. We agree with Floridi that much can be learned from these registers about the role of AI systems in municipal city management. Yet, the lessons we draw, on the basis of our extensive ethnographic engagement with digital well-fare states are distinctly less optimistic.",

      "abstract": "In recent years the cybersecurity policy debate in Washington has been dominated by calls for greater information sharing within the private sector, and between the private sector and the federal government. The passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) (signed into law under the Cybersecurity Act of 2015) underscored federal efforts to collect information from the private sector, and assuaged some concerns regarding private sector liability in sharing activities. However, the law lacked specificity on how continued federal efforts would work with existing information sharing networks, and failed to address other challenges associated with sharing including trust building, privacy and propriety interests, reciprocation, and quality control. This paper aims to bring granularity to implementations of information sharing initiatives by creating a taxonomy of the governance and policy models within each of these organizations. The research shows how this diverse ecosystem of sharing models work together and separately, and the impact governance and policy have on key components critical to sharing infrastructure.",

The motivation is that this would be a catalyst for a transformative change in every aspect of citizen life. Some web services must be protected from any unauthorised usages and passwords remain the most widely used credential mechanism for this purpose. However, if passwords are not adopted properly, they can be a cause for security breach. That is why it is important to study different aspects of password security on different websites. In this paper, we present a study of password security among 36 different Bangladeshi government websites against six carefully chosen password security heuristics. This study is the first of its kind in this domain and offers interesting insights. For example, many websites have not adopted proper security measures with respect to security. There is no password construction guideline adopted by many websites, thus creating a barrier for users to select a strong password. Some of them allow supposedly weak passwords and still do not utilise a secure HTTPS channel to transmit information over the Internet.",

This model bridges digital and non-digital information exchange. By considering the question of governed data usage through the angle of the Principal-Agent problem, we build a distributed governance model based on Autonomous Principals defined as entities capable of choice, therefore capable of exercising a transactional sovereignty. Extending the legal concept of the privacy sphere to a functional equivalent in the digital space leads to the construction of a digital self to which rights and accountability can be attached. Ecosystems, defined as communities of autonomous principals bound by a legitimate authority, provide the basis of interacting structures of increasing complexity endowed with a self-replicating property that mirrors physical world governance systems. The model proposes a governance concept for multi-stakeholder information systems operating across jurisdictions. Using recent software engineering advances in decentralised authentication and semantics, we provide a framework, Dynamic Data Economy to deploy a distributed governance model embedding checks and balance between human and technological governance. Domain specific governance models are left for further publications. Similarly, the technical questions related to the connection between a digital-self and its physical world controller (e.g biometric binding) will be treated in upcoming publications.",

      "abstract": "In the international development community, the term \"digital public goods\" is used to describe open-source digital products (e.g., software, datasets) that aim to address the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. DPGs are increasingly being used to deliver government services around the world (e.g., ID management, healthcare registration). Because DPGs may handle sensitive data, the UN has established user privacy as a first-order requirement for DPGs. The privacy risks of DPGs are currently managed in part by the DPG standard, which includes a prerequisite questionnaire with questions designed to evaluate a DPG's privacy posture.   This study examines the effectiveness of the current DPG standard for ensuring adequate privacy protections. We present a systematic assessment of responses from DPGs regarding their protections of users' privacy. We also present in-depth case studies from three widely-used DPGs to identify privacy threats and compare this to their responses to the DPG standard. Our findings reveal limitations in the current DPG standard's evaluation approach. We conclude by presenting preliminary recommendations and suggestions for strengthening the DPG standard as it relates to privacy. Additionally, we hope this study encourages more usable privacy research on communicating privacy, not only to end users but also third-party adopters of user-facing technologies.",

The protocol is specifically designed to fit the needs of random selection as it is performed in public sphere and is inspired by real problems, which are posing difficulties for Bulgarian judicial system. Random selection in public sphere is meant to be mechanism for increasing the transparency and reducing the possibilities of collusion between various government actors. Usage of computers reduces transparency and when done improperly, can lead to disastrous consequences concerning the public trust in the institutions of government. This protocol tries to provide technical solution to the transparency problem by allowing third parties to guarantee for the fairness of the random selection without giving these parties the ability to influence maliciously the result.",

      "abstract": "Spending on cybersecurity products and services is expected to top 123 billion U.S. dollars for 2020, more than double the 55 billion U.S. dollars spent in 2011.1 In that same period, cyber breaches quadrupled. Organizations globally face increasing liabilities, while boards of directors grapple with a seemingly Sisyphean challenge. Cyber Crossroads was born out of these alarming trends and a realization that the world cannot go on funneling finite resources into an indefinite, intractable problem. Cyber Crossroads brings together expertise from across the world, spanning aspects of the cyber problem (including technology, legal, risk, and economic) with the goal of creating a Cyber Standard of Care built through a global, not-for-profit research collaborative with no commercial interests. A Cyber Standard of Care should be applicable across industries and regardless of the organization size. It should be practical and implementable, with no requirement to purchase any product/service. Cyber Standard of Care should be woven into the existing governance fabric of the organization and it should not be yet another technical checklist, but a process/governance framework that can stand over time. To achieve this, we engaged with cyber risk experts and practitioners with a variety of relevant expertise, secured the advice/guidance of regulators and legal experts across jurisdictions, and interviewed leaders from 56 organizations globally to understand their challenges and identify best practices.",

The concept of multiple layered design based on Blockchain Governance Games frameworks could handle multiple number of networks analytically. The Multi-Layered Blockchain Governance Game is an innovative analytical model to find the best strategies for executing a safety operation to protect whole multiple layered network systems from attackers. This research fully analyzes a complex network with the compact mathematical forms and theoretically tractable results for predicting the moment of a safety operation execution are fully obtained. Additionally, simulation results are demonstrated to obtain the optimal values of configuring parameters of a blockchain-based security network. The Matlab codes for the simulations are publicly available to help those whom are constructing an enhanced decentralized security network architecture through this proposed integrated theoretical framework.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the integration of technology into daily life has led to the creation of an extensive network of interconnected devices, transforming how individuals and organizations operate. However, this digital transformation has also spurred the rise of cybercrime, criminal activities perpetrated through networks or computer systems. Cybercrime has become a global concern, presenting significant challenges to security systems. Although advancements in digital technology have enhanced efficiency, they have also opened new avenues for exploitation by cybercriminals, highlighting the urgent need for advanced cybersecurity measures. The escalating number of cyberattacks and associated risks in the past decade highlights the critical importance of protecting sensitive data and safeguarding information systems. Cybercrimes range from financial fraud and phishing scams to identity theft and online harassment, posing substantial risks to both individuals and organizations. In response, governments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity units have intensified their efforts to address these threats. In recent years, India has experienced a significant surge in cybercrime incidents, with a notable increase in cases involving ransomware, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. The growing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the rapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and organizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include banking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there is an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust regulatory frameworks. This paper examines cybercrime, prevention strategies, security protocols, and terminology to safeguard digital infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "In a traditional cloud storage system, users benefit from the convenience it provides but also take the risk of certain security and privacy issues. To ensure confidentiality while maintaining data sharing capabilities, the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme can be used to achieve fine-grained access control in cloud services. However, existing approaches are impaired by three critical concerns: illegal authorization, key disclosure, and privacy leakage.   To address these, we propose a blockchain-based data governance system that employs blockchain technology and attribute-based encryption to prevent privacy leakage and credential misuse. First, our ABE encryption system can handle multi-authority use cases while protecting identity privacy and hiding access policy, which also protects data sharing against corrupt authorities. Second, applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption makes the whole system efficient and responsive to real-world conditions. Furthermore, the encrypted data is stored in a decentralized storage system such as IPFS, which does not rely on any centralized service provider and is, therefore, resilient against single-point failures. Third, illegal authorization activity can be readily identified through the logged on-chain data. Besides the system design, we also provide security proofs to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed system.",
