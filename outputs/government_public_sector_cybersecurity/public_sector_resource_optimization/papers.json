      "abstract": "Local and federal agencies are rapidly adopting AI systems to augment or automate critical decisions, efficiently use resources, and improve public service delivery. AI systems are being used to support tasks associated with urban planning, security, surveillance, energy and critical infrastructure, and support decisions that directly affect citizens and their ability to access essential services. Local governments act as the governance tier closest to citizens and must play a critical role in upholding democratic values and building community trust especially as it relates to smart city initiatives that seek to transform public services through the adoption of AI. Community-centered and participatory approaches have been central for ensuring the appropriate adoption of technology; however, AI innovation introduces new challenges in this context because participatory AI design methods require more robust formulation and face higher standards for implementation in the public sector compared to the private sector. This requires us to reassess traditional methods used in this space as well as develop new resources and methods. This workshop will explore emerging practices in participatory algorithm design - or the use of public participation and community engagement - in the scoping, design, adoption, and implementation of public sector algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The cybersecurity threat landscape is constantly actively making it imperative to develop sound frameworks to protect the IT structures. Based on this introduction, this paper aims to discuss the application of cybersecurity frameworks into the IT security with focus placed on the role of such frameworks in addressing the changing nature of cybersecurity threats. It explores widely used models, including the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Zero Trust Architecture, and the ISO/IEC 27001, and how they apply to industries including finance, healthcare and government. The discussion also singles out such technologies as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as the core for real-time threat detection and response mechanisms. As these integration challenges demonstrate, the study provides tangible and proven approaches to tackle framework implementation issues such as legitimate security issues, limited availability of funds and resources, and compliance with legal requirements. By capturing current trends and exposures, the findings promote strong, portfolio-based and risk-appropriate security approaches adjusted for organizational goals and capable to prevent advanced cyber threats.",

      "abstract": "Protecting against cyber-threats is vital for every organization and can be done by investing in cybersecurity controls and purchasing cyber insurance. However, these are interlinked since insurance premiums could be reduced by investing more in cybersecurity controls. The expected utility theory and the prospect theory are two alternative theories explaining decision-making under risk and uncertainty, which can inform strategies for optimizing resource allocation. While the former is considered a rational approach, research has shown that most people make decisions consistent with the latter, including on insurance uptakes. We compare and contrast these two approaches to provide important insights into how the two approaches could lead to different optimal allocations resulting in differing risk exposure as well as financial costs. We introduce the concept of a risk curve and show that identifying the nature of the risk curve is a key step in deriving the optimal resource allocation.",

      "abstract": "The abundance of cyber-physical components in modern day power grid with their diverse hardware and software vulnerabilities has made it difficult to protect them from advanced persistent threats (APTs). An attack graph depicting the propagation of potential cyber-attack sequences from the initial access point to the end objective is vital to identify critical weaknesses of any cyber-physical system. A cyber security personnel can accordingly plan preventive mitigation measures for the identified weaknesses addressing the cyber-attack sequences. However, limitations on available cybersecurity budget restrict the choice of mitigation measures. We address this aspect through our framework, which solves the following problem: given potential cyber-attack sequences for a cyber-physical component in the power grid, find the optimal manner to allocate an available budget to implement necessary preventive mitigation measures. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to identify the optimal budget partition and set of mitigation measures which minimize the vulnerability of cyber-physical components to potential attack sequences. We assume that the allocation of budget affects the efficacy of the mitigation measures. We show how altering the budget allocation for tasks such as asset management, cybersecurity infrastructure improvement, incident response planning and employee training affects the choice of the optimal set of preventive mitigation measures and modifies the associated cybersecurity risk. The proposed framework can be used by cyber policymakers and system owners to allocate optimal budgets for various tasks required to improve the overall security of a cyber-physical system.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity governance influences the quality of strategic decision-making to ensure cyber risks are managed effectively. Board of Directors are the decisions-makers held accountable for managing this risk; however, they lack adequate and efficient information necessary for making such decisions. In addition to the myriad of challenges they face, they are often insufficiently versed in the technology or cybersecurity terminology or not provided with the correct tools to support them to make sound decisions to govern cybersecurity effectively. A different approach is needed to ensure BoDs are clear on the approach the business is taking to build a cyber resilient organization. This systematic literature review investigates the existing risk measurement instruments, cybersecurity metrics, and associated models for supporting BoDs. We identified seven conceptual themes through literature analysis that form the basis of this study's main contribution. The findings showed that, although sophisticated cybersecurity tools exist and are developing, there is limited information for Board of Directors to support them in terms of metrics and models to govern cybersecurity in a language they understand. The review also provides some recommendations on theories and models that can be further investigated to provide support to Board of Directors.",

      "abstract": "Recent advancements in generative machine learning have enabled rapid progress in biological design tools (BDTs) such as protein structure and sequence prediction models. The unprecedented predictive accuracy and novel design capabilities of BDTs present new and significant dual-use risks. For example, their predictive accuracy allows biological agents, whether vaccines or pathogens, to be developed more quickly, while the design capabilities could be used to discover drugs or evade DNA screening techniques. Similar to other dual-use AI systems, BDTs present a wicked problem: how can regulators uphold public safety without stifling innovation? We highlight how current regulatory proposals that are primarily tailored toward large language models may be less effective for BDTs, which require fewer computational resources to train and are often developed in an open-source manner. We propose a range of measures to mitigate the risk that BDTs are misused, across the areas of responsible development, risk assessment, transparency, access management, cybersecurity, and investing in resilience. Implementing such measures will require close coordination between developers and governments.",

      "abstract": "The increasing frequency, impact, consequence and sophistication of cybersecurity attacks is becoming a strategic concern for boards and executive management of organisations. Consequently, in addition to focusing on productivity and performance, organisations are prioritizing Information Security Management (ISM). However, research has revealed little or no conceptualisation of a dynamic ISM capability and its link to organisational performance. In this research, we set out to 1) define and describe an organisational level dynamic ISM capability, 2) to develop a strategic model that links resources with this dynamic capability, and then 3) empirically demonstrate how dynamic ISM capability contributes to firm performance. By drawing on Resource-Based Theory (RBT) and Dynamic Capabilities View (DCV), we have developed the Dynamic ISM Capability model to address the identified gap. As we develop this research, we will empirically test this model to demonstrate causality between ISM capability and organisational performance.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with design of the alternative secure Blockchain network framework to prevent damages from an attacker. The concept of the strategic alliance of the management is applied on the top of the recent developed stochastic game framework. This new enhanced hybrid theoretical model has been developed based on the combination of the conventional game theory, the fluctuation theory and the Blockchain Governance Game to find best strategies towards preparation for preventing a network malfunction from an attacker by making the strategic alliance with other genuine miners. Analytically tractable results for decision making parameters are fully obtained which enable to predict the moment for operations and deliver the optimal number of the alliance with other nodes to protect the Blockchain network. This research helps for whom considers the initial coin offering or launching new blockchain based services with enhancing the security features by alliance with the trusted miners within the decentralized network.",

      "authors": [
        "Hayette Gatfaoui"
      ],
      "abstract": "Energy markets are strategic to governments and economic development. Several commodities compete as substitutable energy sources and energy diversifiers. Such competition reduces the energy vulnerability of countries as well as portfolios' risk exposure. Vulnerability results mainly from price trends and fluctuations, following supply and demand shocks. Such energy price uncertainty attracts many market participants in the energy commodity markets. First, energy producers and consumers hedge adverse price changes with energy derivatives. Second, financial market participants use commodities and commodity derivatives to diversify their conventional portfolios. For that reason, we consider the joint dependence between the United States (U.S.) natural gas, crude oil and stock markets. We use Gatfaoui's (2015) time varying multivariate copula analysis and related variance regimes. Such approach handles structural changes in asset prices. In this light, we draw implications for portfolio optimization, when investors diversify their stock portfolios with natural gas and crude oil assets. We minimize the portfolio's variance, semi-variance and tail risk, in the presence and the absence of constraints on the portfolio's expected return and/or U.S. stock investment. The return constraint reduces the performance of the optimal portfolio. Moreover, the regime-specific portfolio optimization helps implement an enhanced active management strategy over the whole sample period. Under a return constraint, the semi-variance optimal portfolio offers the best risk-return tradeoff, whereas the tail-risk optimal portfolio offers the best tradeoff in the absence of a return constraint.",
