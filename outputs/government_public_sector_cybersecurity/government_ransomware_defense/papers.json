      "abstract": "The availability of public services through online platforms has improved the coverage and efficiency of essential services provided to citizens worldwide. These services also promote transparency and foster citizen participation in government processes. However, the increased online presence also exposes sensitive data exchanged between citizens and service providers to a wider range of security threats. Therefore, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of online services is crucial to Electronic Government (EGOV) initiatives' success. Hence, this work assesses the security posture of online platforms hosted in 3068 governmental domain names, across all UN Member States, in three dimensions: support for secure communication protocols; the trustworthiness of their digital certificate chains; and services' exposure to known vulnerabilities. The results indicate that despite its rapid development, the public sector still falls short in adopting international standards and best security practices in services and infrastructure management. This reality poses significant risks to citizens and services across all regions and income levels.",

      "abstract": "As machine learning becomes a more mainstream technology, the objective for governments and public sectors is to harness the power of machine learning to advance their mission by revolutionizing public services. Motivational government use cases require special considerations for implementation given the significance of the services they provide. Not only will these applications be deployed in a potentially hostile environment that necessitates protective mechanisms, but they are also subject to government transparency and accountability initiatives which further complicates such protections.   In this paper, we describe how the inevitable interactions between a user of unknown trustworthiness and the machine learning models, deployed in governments and public sectors, can jeopardize the system in two major ways: by compromising the integrity or by violating the privacy. We then briefly overview the possible attacks and defense scenarios, and finally, propose recommendations and guidelines that once considered can enhance the security and privacy of the provided services.",

      "abstract": "We propose distributed protocol for generation of random numbers via computer systems. The protocol is specifically designed to fit the needs of random selection as it is performed in public sphere and is inspired by real problems, which are posing difficulties for Bulgarian judicial system. Random selection in public sphere is meant to be mechanism for increasing the transparency and reducing the possibilities of collusion between various government actors. Usage of computers reduces transparency and when done improperly, can lead to disastrous consequences concerning the public trust in the institutions of government. This protocol tries to provide technical solution to the transparency problem by allowing third parties to guarantee for the fairness of the random selection without giving these parties the ability to influence maliciously the result.",
