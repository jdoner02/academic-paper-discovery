      "abstract": "The rise of ransomware attacks has necessitated the development of effective strategies for identifying and mitigating these threats. This research investigates the utilization of a feature selection algorithm for distinguishing ransomware-related and benign transactions in both Bitcoin (BTC) and United States Dollar (USD). Leveraging the UGRansome dataset, a comprehensive repository of ransomware related BTC and USD transactions, we propose a set of novel features designed to capture the distinct characteristics of ransomware activity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. These features encompass transaction metadata, ransom analysis, and behavioral patterns, offering a multifaceted view of ransomware-related financial transactions. Through rigorous experimentation and evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our feature set in accurately extracting BTC and USD transactions, thereby aiding in the early detection and prevention of ransomware-related financial flows. We introduce a Ransomware Feature Selection Algorithm (RFSA) based on Gini Impurity and Mutual Information (MI) for selecting crucial ransomware features from the UGRansome dataset. Insights from the visualization highlight the potential of Gini Impurity and MI-based feature selection to enhance ransomware detection systems by effectively discriminating between ransomware classes. The analysis reveals that approximately 68% of ransomware incidents involve BTC transactions within the range of 1.46 to 2.56, with an average of 2.01 BTC transactions per attack. The findings emphasize the dynamic and adaptable nature of ransomware demands, suggesting that there is no fixed amount for specific cyberattacks, highlighting the evolving landscape of ransomware threats.",

      "abstract": "Ransomware attacks are among the most severe cyber threats. They have made headlines in recent years by threatening the operation of governments, critical infrastructure, and corporations. Collecting and analyzing ransomware data is an important step towards understanding the spread of ransomware and designing effective defense and mitigation mechanisms. We report on our experience operating Ransomwhere, an open crowdsourced ransomware payment tracker to collect information from victims of ransomware attacks. With Ransomwhere, we have gathered 13.5k ransom payments to more than 87 ransomware criminal actors with total payments of more than $101 million. Leveraging the transparent nature of Bitcoin, the cryptocurrency used for most ransomware payments, we characterize the evolving ransomware criminal structure and ransom laundering strategies. Our analysis shows that there are two parallel ransomware criminal markets: commodity ransomware and Ransomware as a Service (RaaS). We notice that there are striking differences between the two markets in the way that cryptocurrency resources are utilized, revenue per transaction, and ransom laundering efficiency. Although it is relatively easy to identify choke points in commodity ransomware payment activity, it is more difficult to do the same for RaaS.",

AI systems are being used to support tasks associated with urban planning, security, surveillance, energy and critical infrastructure, and support decisions that directly affect citizens and their ability to access essential services. Local governments act as the governance tier closest to citizens and must play a critical role in upholding democratic values and building community trust especially as it relates to smart city initiatives that seek to transform public services through the adoption of AI. Community-centered and participatory approaches have been central for ensuring the appropriate adoption of technology; however, AI innovation introduces new challenges in this context because participatory AI design methods require more robust formulation and face higher standards for implementation in the public sector compared to the private sector. This requires us to reassess traditional methods used in this space as well as develop new resources and methods. This workshop will explore emerging practices in participatory algorithm design - or the use of public participation and community engagement - in the scoping, design, adoption, and implementation of public sector algorithms.",

      "abstract": "The spread of ransomware continues to cause devastation and is a major concern for the security community. An often-used technique against this threat is the use of honey (or canary) files, which serve as ``trip wires'' to detect ransomware in its early stages. However, in our analysis of ransomware samples from the wild, we discovered that attackers are well-aware of these traps, and newer variants use several evasive strategies to bypass traditional honey files. Hence, we present the design of SentryFS - a specialized file system that strategically ``sprays'' specially-crafted honey files across the file system. The canaries are generated using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and the content and the metadata is constantly updated to make the canaries appear more attractive for smarter ransomware that is selective in choosing victim files. Furthermore, to assist with the management of the honey files, SentryFS connects with an anti-ransomware web service to download the latest intelligence on novel ransomware strategies to update the canaries. Finally, as a contingency, SentryFS also leverages file clones to prevent processes from writing to files directly in the event a highly stealthy ransomware goes undetected. In this case, the ransomware encrypts the clones rather than the actual files, leaving users' data unmodified. An AI agent then assigns a suspicion score to the write activity so that users can approve/discard the changes. As an early-warning system, the proposed design might help mitigate the problem of ransomware.",

According to Homeland Security statistics, 1.5 million ransomware attacks have occurred per year since 2016. Cybercriminals often use creative methods to inject their malware into the target machines and use sophisticated cryptographic techniques to hold hostage victims' files and programs unless a certain amount of equivalent Bitcoin is paid. The return to the cybercriminals is so high (estimated \\$1 billion in 2019) without any cost because of the advanced anonymity provided by cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin \\cite{Paquet-Clouston2019}. Given this context, this study first discusses the current state of ransomware, detection, and prevention systems.

With over 500 known ransomware families, it has become one of the dominant cybercrime threats for law enforcement, security professionals and the public. However, a more comprehensive, evidence-based picture on the global direct financial impact of ransomware attacks is still missing. In this paper, we present a data-driven method for identifying and gathering information on Bitcoin transactions related to illicit activity based on footprints left on the public Bitcoin blockchain. We implement this method on-top-of the GraphSense open-source platform and apply it to empirically analyze transactions related to 35 ransomware families. We estimate the lower bound direct financial impact of each ransomware family and find that, from 2013 to mid-2017, the market for ransomware payments has a minimum worth of USD 12,768,536 (22,967.54 BTC). We also find that the market is highly skewed with only a few number of players responsible for the majority of the payments. Based on these research findings, policy-makers and law enforcement agencies can use the statistics provided to understand the size of the illicit market and make informed decisions on how best to address the threat.",

In this case study, we examined eight municipal organizations in the Netherlands regarding their actual and intended use of ADM. We interviewed key personnel and decision makers. Our results show that municipalities mostly use ADM in an ad hoc manner, and they have not systematically defined or institutionalized a data science process yet. They operate risk averse, and they clearly express the need for cooperation, guidance, and even supervision at the national level. Third parties, mostly commercial, are often involved in the ADM development lifecycle, without systematic governance. Communication on the use of ADM is generally responsive to negative attention from the media and public. There are strong indications for the need of an ADM governance framework. In this paper, we present our findings in detail, along with actionable insights on governance, communication, and performance evaluation of ADM systems.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, ransomware has been one of the most notorious malware targeting end users, governments, and business organizations. It has become a very profitable business for cybercriminals with revenues of millions of dollars, and a very serious threat to organizations with financial loss of billions of dollars. Numerous studies were proposed to address the ransomware threat, including surveys that cover certain aspects of ransomware research. However, no study exists in the literature that gives the complete picture on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to the diversity of targeted platforms. Since ransomware is already prevalent in PCs/workstations/desktops/laptops, is becoming more prevalent in mobile devices, and has already hit IoT/CPS recently, and will likely grow further in the IoT/CPS domain very soon, understanding ransomware and analyzing defense mechanisms with respect to target platforms is becoming more imperative. In order to fill this gap and motivate further research, in this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on ransomware and ransomware defense research with respect to PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS platforms. Specifically, covering 137 studies over the period of 1990-2020, we give a detailed overview of ransomware evolution, comprehensively analyze the key building blocks of ransomware, present a taxonomy of notable ransomware families, and provide an extensive overview of ransomware defense research (i.e., analysis, detection, and recovery) with respect to platforms of PCs/workstations, mobile devices, and IoT/CPS. Moreover, we derive an extensive list of open issues for future ransomware research. We believe this survey will motivate further research by giving a complete picture on state-of-the-art ransomware research.",

      "abstract": "Ransomware is a growing threat to individuals and enterprises alike, constituting a major factor in cyber insurance and in the security planning of every organization. Although the game theoretic lens often frames the game as a competition between equals -- a profit maximizing attacker and a loss minimizing defender -- the reality of many situations is that ransomware organizations are not playing a non-cooperative game, they are playing a lottery. The wanton behavior of attackers creates a situation where many victims are hit more than once by ransomware operators, sometimes even by the same group. If defenders wish to combat malware, they must then seek to remove the incentives of it.   In this work, we construct an expected value model based on data from actual ransomware attacks and identify three variables: the value of payments, the cost of an attack, and the probability of payment. Using this model, we consider the potential to manipulate these variables to reduce the profit motive associated with ransomware attack. Based on the model, we present mitigations to encourage an environment that is hostile to ransomware operators. In particular, we find that off-site backups and government incentives for their adoption are the most fruitful avenue for combating ransomware.",

The recently revealed strikes of ransomware attacks have already resulted in significant economic losses and societal harm across different sectors, ranging from local governments to health care.   Most modern ransomware use Bitcoin for payments. However, although Bitcoin transactions are permanently recorded and publicly available, current approaches for detecting ransomware depend only on a couple of heuristics and/or tedious information gathering steps (e.g., running ransomware to collect ransomware related Bitcoin addresses). To our knowledge, none of the previous approaches have employed advanced data analytics techniques to automatically detect ransomware related transactions and malicious Bitcoin addresses.   By capitalizing on the recent advances in topological data analysis, we propose an efficient and tractable data analytics framework to automatically detect new malicious addresses in a ransomware family, given only a limited records of previous transactions. Furthermore, our proposed techniques exhibit high utility to detect the emergence of new ransomware families, that is, ransomware with no previous records of transactions. Using the existing known ransomware data sets, we show that our proposed methodology provides significant improvements in precision and recall for ransomware transaction detection, compared to existing heuristic based approaches, and can be utilized to automate ransomware detection.",

While various recent security-based approaches have focused on detecting and classifying ransomware at the network or system level, easy-to-use post-infection ransomware classification for the lay user has not been attempted before. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of classifying the ransomware a system is infected with simply based on a screenshot of the splash screen or the ransom note captured using a consumer camera commonly found in any modern mobile device. To train and evaluate our system, we create a sample dataset of the splash screens of 50 well-known ransomware variants. In our dataset, only a single training image is available per ransomware. Instead of creating a large training dataset of ransomware screenshots, we simulate screenshot capture conditions via carefully designed data augmentation techniques, enabling simple and efficient one-shot learning. Moreover, using model uncertainty obtained via Bayesian approximation, we ensure special input cases such as unrelated non-ransomware images and previously-unseen ransomware variants are correctly identified for special handling and not mis-classified. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of our work, with accuracy levels of up to 93.6% for ransomware classification.",

      "abstract": "Crypto-ransomware remains a significant threat to governments and companies alike, with high-profile cyber security incidents regularly making headlines. Many different detection systems have been proposed as solutions to the ever-changing dynamic landscape of ransomware detection. In the majority of cases, these described systems propose a method based on the result of a single test performed on either the executable code, the process under investigation, its behaviour, or its output. In a small subset of ransomware detection systems, the concept of a scorecard is employed where multiple tests are performed on various aspects of a process under investigation and their results are then analysed using machine learning. The purpose of this paper is to propose a new majority voting approach to ransomware detection by developing a method that uses a cumulative score derived from discrete tests based on calculations using algorithmic rather than heuristic techniques. The paper describes 23 candidate tests, as well as 9 Windows API tests which are validated to determine both their accuracy and viability for use within a ransomware detection system. Using a cumulative score calculation approach to ransomware detection has several benefits, such as the immunity to the occasional inaccuracy of individual tests when making its final classification. The system can also leverage multiple tests that can be both comprehensive and complimentary in an attempt to achieve a broader, deeper, and more robust analysis of the program under investigation. Additionally, the use of multiple collaborative tests also significantly hinders ransomware from masking or modifying its behaviour in an attempt to bypass detection.",

      "abstract": "The commoditization of Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) allows criminals to obtain financial benefits at a low risk and with little technical background. One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains.   In this work, we perform an in-depth analysis of Avaddon, a ransomware offered in the underground economy as an affiliate program business. This has infected and leaked data from at least 23 organizations. Additionally, it runs Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks against victims that do not pay the ransom. We first provide an analysis of the criminal business model from the underground economy. Then, we identify and describe its technical capabilities. We provide empirical evidence of links between this variant and a previous family, suggesting that the same group was behind the development and, possibly, the operation of both campaigns.   Finally, we describe a method to decrypt files encrypted with Avaddon in real time. We implement and test the decryptor in a tool that can recover the encrypted data from an infected system, thus mitigating the damage caused by the ransomware. The tool is released open-source so it can be incorporated in existing Antivirus engines.",

      "abstract": "Public sector agencies are rapidly deploying AI systems to augment or automate critical decisions in real-world contexts like child welfare, criminal justice, and public health. A growing body of work documents how these AI systems often fail to improve services in practice. These failures can often be traced to decisions made during the early stages of AI ideation and design, such as problem formulation. However, today, we lack systematic processes to support effective, early-stage decision-making about whether and under what conditions to move forward with a proposed AI project. To understand how to scaffold such processes in real-world settings, we worked with public sector agency leaders, AI developers, frontline workers, and community advocates across four public sector agencies and three community advocacy groups in the United States. Through an iterative co-design process, we created the Situate AI Guidebook: a structured process centered around a set of deliberation questions to scaffold conversations around (1) goals and intended use or a proposed AI system, (2) societal and legal considerations, (3) data and modeling constraints, and (4) organizational governance factors. We discuss how the guidebook's design is informed by participants' challenges, needs, and desires for improved deliberation processes. We further elaborate on implications for designing responsible AI toolkits in collaboration with public sector agency stakeholders and opportunities for future work to expand upon the guidebook. This design approach can be more broadly adopted to support the co-creation of responsible AI toolkits that scaffold key decision-making processes surrounding the use of AI in the public sector and beyond.",

      "abstract": "In the face of increasing cyber threats, particularly ransomware attacks, there is a pressing need for advanced detection and analysis systems that adapt to evolving malware behaviours. Throughout the literature, using machine learning (ML) to obviate ransomware attacks has increased in popularity. Unfortunately, most of these proposals leverage non-incremental learning approaches that require the underlying models to be updated from scratch to detect new ransomware, wasting time and resources. This approach is problematic because it leaves sensitive data vulnerable to attack during retraining, as newly emerging ransomware strains may go undetected until the model is updated. Furthermore, most of these approaches are not designed to detect ransomware in real-time data streams, limiting their effectiveness in complex network environments. To address this challenge, we present the Sysmon Incremental Learning System for Ransomware Analysis and Detection (SILRAD), which enables continuous updates to the underlying model and effectively closes the training gap. By leveraging the capabilities of Sysmon for detailed monitoring of system activities, our approach integrates online incremental learning techniques to enhance the adaptability and efficiency of ransomware detection. The most valuable features for detection were selected using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC), and concept drift detection was implemented through the ADWIN algorithm, ensuring that the model remains responsive to changes in ransomware behaviour. We compared our results to other popular techniques, such as Hoeffding Trees (HT) and Leveraging Bagging Classifier (LB), observing a detection accuracy of 98.89% and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) rate of 94.11%, demonstrating the effectiveness of our technique.",

      "abstract": "Since the 1990s, the integration of technology into daily life has led to the creation of an extensive network of interconnected devices, transforming how individuals and organizations operate. However, this digital transformation has also spurred the rise of cybercrime, criminal activities perpetrated through networks or computer systems. Cybercrime has become a global concern, presenting significant challenges to security systems. Although advancements in digital technology have enhanced efficiency, they have also opened new avenues for exploitation by cybercriminals, highlighting the urgent need for advanced cybersecurity measures. The escalating number of cyberattacks and associated risks in the past decade highlights the critical importance of protecting sensitive data and safeguarding information systems. Cybercrimes range from financial fraud and phishing scams to identity theft and online harassment, posing substantial risks to both individuals and organizations. In response, governments, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity units have intensified their efforts to address these threats. In recent years, India has experienced a significant surge in cybercrime incidents, with a notable increase in cases involving ransomware, data breaches, and social engineering attacks. The growing penetration of internet services, the expansion of e-commerce, and the rapid adoption of digital payment systems have made individuals and organizations more vulnerable to cyber threats. Key areas affected include banking, healthcare, and government sectors, which are frequently targeted due to the sensitive nature of the data they handle. To combat these risks, there is an increasing focus on public awareness, cybersecurity education, and robust regulatory frameworks. This paper examines cybercrime, prevention strategies, security protocols, and terminology to safeguard digital infrastructure.",

However, most research summarizes the general features of AI and induces many false positives, as the behavior of ransomware constantly differs to bypass detection. Focusing on the key indicating features of ransomware becomes vital as this guides the investigator to the inner workings and main function of ransomware itself. By utilizing access privileges in process memory, the main function of the ransomware can be detected more easily and accurately. Furthermore, new signatures and fingerprints of ransomware families can be identified to classify novel ransomware attacks correctly. The current research used the process memory access privileges of the different memory regions of the behavior of an executable to quickly determine its intent before serious harm can occur. To achieve this aim, several well-known machine learning algorithms were explored with an accuracy range of 81.38 to 96.28 percents. The study thus confirms the feasibility of utilizing process memory as a detection mechanism for ransomware.",

While Windows-based ransomware predominantly uses RSA and AES for key management, a variety of approaches was identified for Linux. Cybercriminals appear to be deliberately moving away from RSA and AES to make Live forensic investigations more difficult. Linux ransomware is developed for a predefined goal and does not exploit the full potential of damage. It appears in an early stage and is expected to reach a similar potential to Windows-based malware.

As AI decisions become inescapable, entering domains such as healthcare, education, and law, we must confront a vital question: how can we ensure AI systems have the legitimacy necessary for effective governance? This essay argues that to secure AI legitimacy, we need methods that engage the public in designing and constraining AI systems, ensuring these technologies reflect the community's shared values. Constitutional AI, proposed by Anthropic, represents a step towards this goal, offering a model for democratic control of AI. However, while Constitutional AI's commitment to hardcoding explicit principles into AI models enhances transparency and accountability, it falls short in two crucial aspects: addressing the opacity of individual AI decisions and fostering genuine democratic legitimacy. To overcome these limitations, this essay proposes \"Public Constitutional AI.\" This approach envisions a participatory process where diverse stakeholders, including ordinary citizens, deliberate on the principles guiding AI development. The resulting \"AI Constitution\" would carry the legitimacy of popular authorship, grounding AI governance in the public will. Furthermore, the essay proposes \"AI Courts\" to develop \"AI case law,\" providing concrete examples for operationalizing constitutional principles in AI training. This evolving combination of constitutional principles and case law aims to make AI governance more responsive to public values. By grounding AI governance in deliberative democratic processes, Public Constitutional AI offers a path to imbue automated authorities with genuine democratic legitimacy, addressing the unique challenges posed by increasingly powerful AI systems while ensuring their alignment with the public interest.",

We evaluate the capacity of existing oversight structures to meet these challenges, via a mixed-methods approach consisting of a literature review and interviews with civil servants in AI-related roles. We find that agent oversight poses intensified versions of three existing governance challenges: continuous oversight, deeper integration of governance and operational capabilities, and interdepartmental coordination.

Utilizing a questionnaire-based experimental design, the research involved citizens and civil servants who evaluated both original and AI-modified communication samples across five interaction types: Service Requests, Policy Inquiries, Complaints, Suggestions, and Emergency Concerns. Statistical analyses revealed that AI modifications significantly enhanced most communication dimensions for both citizens and civil servants. Specifically, AI-assisted responses led to higher satisfaction, politeness, clarity, and trust among citizens, while also improving clarity, politeness, responsiveness, and respect among civil servants. However, AI interventions showed mixed effects on empathy and urgency from the civil servants' perspective, indicating areas for further refinement. The findings suggest that AI has substantial potential to improve citizen-government interactions, fostering more effective and satisfying communication, while also highlighting the need for continued development to address emotional and urgent communication nuances.",

Unfortunately, intelligent ransomware can easily bypass these techniques. Another prevention technique is to recover from the backup copy when a file is infected with ransomware. However, the data backup technique requires extra storage space and can be removed with ransomware. In this paper, we propose to implement an access control mechanism on a disk drive, called a KEY-SSD disk drive. KEY-SSD is the data store and the last barrier to data protection. Unauthorized applications will not be able to read file data even if they bypass the file system defense, thus denying the block request without knowing the disk's registered block key and completely eliminating the possibility of the file becoming hostage to ransomware. We have prototyped KEY-SSD and validated the usefulness of KEY-SSD by demonstrating 1) selective block access control, 2) unauthorized data access blocking and 3) negligible performance overhead. Our comprehensive evaluation of KEY-SSD for various workloads show the KEY-SSD performance is hardly degraded due to OS lightweight key transmission and access control drive optimization. We also confirmed that KEY-SSD successfully protects the files in the actual ransomware sample.",

      "abstract": "This paper examines the potential for Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) to be governed in a decentralised manner, whereby blockchain-based infrastructure facilitates the communication between digital and physical domains through self-governing and self-organising principles. Decentralised governance paradigms that integrate computation in physical domains (such as 'Decentralised Autonomous Organisations' (DAOs)) represent a novel approach to autono-mous governance and operations. These have been described as akin to cybernetic systems. Through the lens of a case study of an autonomous cabin called \"no1s1\" which demonstrates self-ownership via blockchain-based control and feedback loops, this research explores the potential for blockchain infrastructure to be utilised in the management of physical systems. By highlighting the considerations and challenges of decentralised governance in managing autonomous physical spaces, the study reveals that autonomy in the governance of autonomous CPS is not merely a technological feat but also involves a complex mesh of functional and social dynamics. These findings underscore the importance of developing continuous feedback loops and adaptive governance frameworks within decentralised CPS to address both expected and emergent challenges. This investigation contributes to the fields of infra-structure studies and Cyber-Physical Systems engineering. It also contributes to the discourse on decentralised governance and autonomous management of physical spaces by offering both practical insights and providing a framework for future research.",

      "abstract": "Modern societies can be understood as the intersection of four interdependent systems: (1) the natural environment of geography, climate and weather; (2) the built environment of cities, engineered systems, and physical infrastructure; (3) the social environment of human populations, communities and socio-economic activities; and (4) an information ecosystem that overlays the other three domains and provides the means for understanding, interacting with, and managing the relationships between the natural, built, and human environments.   As the nation and its communities become more connected, networked and technologically sophisticated, new challenges and opportunities arise that demand a rethinking of current approaches to public safety and emergency management. Addressing the current and future challenges requires an equally sophisticated program of research, technology development, and strategic planning. The design and integration of intelligent infrastructure-including embedded sensors, the Internet of Things (IoT), advanced wireless information technologies, real-time data capture and analysis, and machine-learning-based decision support-holds the potential to greatly enhance public safety, emergency management, disaster recovery, and overall community resilience, while addressing new and emerging threats to public safety and security. Ultimately, the objective of this program of research and development is to save lives, reduce risk and disaster impacts, permit efficient use of material and social resources, and protect quality of life and economic stability across entire regions.",

Various reports demonstrate the enormous burden placed on companies, which have to grapple with the ongoing attack waves. At the same time, our strategic understanding of the threat and the adversarial interaction between organizations and cybercriminals perpetrating ransomware attacks is lacking.   In this paper, we develop, to the best of our knowledge, the first game-theoretic model of the ransomware ecosystem. Our model captures a multi-stage scenario involving organizations from different industry sectors facing a sophisticated ransomware attacker. We place particular emphasis on the decision of companies to invest in backup technologies as part of a contingency plan, and the economic incentives to pay a ransom if impacted by an attack. We further study to which degree comprehensive industry-wide backup investments can serve as a deterrent for ongoing attacks.",

Humandemics will propagate because of the pathways that connect the different systems and several invariant behaviors and patterns that have emerged globally. On the contrary, infodemics of misinformation can be a risk as it has occurred in the COVID-19 pandemic. The emerging fragility or robustness of the system will depend on how this complex network of systems is governed. Future societal systems will not be only multiscale in terms of the social dimension, but also in the temporality. Necessary and proper prevention and response systems based on complexity, ethic and multi-scale governance will be required. Real-time response systems are the basis for resilience to be the foundation of robust societies. A top-down approach led by Governmental organs for managing humandemics is not sufficient and may be only effective if policies are very restrictive and their efficacy depends not only in the measures implemented but also on the dynamics of the policies and the population perception and compliance. This top-down approach is even weaker if there is not national and international coordination. Coordinating top-down agencies with bottom-up constructs will be the design principle. Multi-scale governance integrates decision-making processes with signaling, sensing and leadership mechanisms to drive thriving societal systems with real-time sensitivity.",

      "abstract": "Ransomware is a growing threat that typically operates by either encrypting a victim's files or locking a victim's computer until the victim pays a ransom. However, it is still challenging to detect such malware timely with existing traditional malware detection techniques. In this paper, we present a novel ransomware detection system, called \"Peeler\" (Profiling kErnEl -Level Events to detect Ransomware). Peeler deviates from signatures for individual ransomware samples and relies on common and generic characteristics of ransomware depicted at the kernel-level. Analyzing diverse ransomware families, we observed ransomware's inherent behavioral characteristics such as stealth operations performed before the attack, file I/O request patterns, process spawning, and correlations among kernel-level events. Based on those characteristics, we develop Peeler that continuously monitors a target system's kernel events and detects ransomware attacks on the system. Our experimental results show that Peeler achieves more than 99\\% detection rate with 0.58\\% false-positive rate against 43 distinct ransomware families, containing samples from both crypto and screen-locker types of ransomware. For crypto ransomware, Peeler detects them promptly after only one file is lost (within 115 milliseconds on average). Peeler utilizes around 4.9\\% of CPU time with only 9.8 MB memory under the normal workload condition. Our analysis demonstrates that Peeler can efficiently detect diverse malware families by monitoring their kernel-level events.",

      "abstract": "The work reported here addresses the capacity of psychophysiological sensors and measures using Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Galvanic Skin Response (GSR) to detect levels of trust for humans using AI-supported Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). Improvements to the analysis of EEG and GSR data may create models that perform as well, or better than, traditional tools. A challenge to analyzing the EEG and GSR data is the large amount of training data required due to a large number of variables in the measurements. Researchers have routinely used standard machine-learning classifiers like artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and K-nearest neighbors (KNN). Traditionally, these have provided few insights into which features of the EEG and GSR data facilitate the more and least accurate predictions - thus making it harder to improve the HMI and human-machine trust relationship. A key ingredient to applying trust-sensor research results to practical situations and monitoring trust in work environments is the understanding of which key features are contributing to trust and then reducing the amount of data needed for practical applications. We used the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) model as a process to reduce the volume of data required to monitor and enhance trust in HMI systems - a technology that could be valuable for governmental and public sector applications. Explainable AI can make HMI systems transparent and promote trust. From customer service in government agencies and community-level non-profit public service organizations to national military and cybersecurity institutions, many public sector organizations are increasingly concerned to have effective and ethical HMI with services that are trustworthy, unbiased, and free of unintended negative consequences.",

SEER integrates the triple-encryption design of the Babuk ransomware family, including Curve25519-based key exchange,SHA-256-based key derivation, and the Sosemanuk stream cipher, to construct a layered key management architecture. It tightly couples encryption and key destruction by securely erasing session keys immediately after use.

A crypto ransomware removes data custodian access by encrypting valuable data on victims' computers and requests a ransom payment to reinstantiate custodian access by decrypting data. Timely detection of ransomware very much depends on how quickly and accurately system logs can be mined to hunt abnormalities and stop the evil. In this paper we first setup an environment to collect activity logs of 517 Locky ransomware samples, 535 Cerber ransomware samples and 572 samples of TeslaCrypt ransomware. We utilize Sequential Pattern Mining to find Maximal Frequent Patterns (MFP) of activities within different ransomware families as candidate features for classification using J48, Random Forest, Bagging and MLP algorithms. We could achieve 99% accuracy in detecting ransomware instances from goodware samples and 96.5% accuracy in detecting family of a given ransomware sample. Our results indicate usefulness and practicality of applying pattern mining techniques in detection of good features for ransomware hunting. Moreover, we showed existence of distinctive frequent patterns within different ransomware families which can be used for identification of a ransomware sample family for building intelligence about threat actors and threat profile of a given target.",

Secondly, an attempt was made to decrypt the files encrypted by the ransomware using the found keys. In all cases, the investigation was able to confirm that it was possible to identify the encryption keys used. A description of how these found keys were then used to successfully decrypt files that had been encrypted during the execution of the ransomware is also given.

      "abstract": "The ransomware threat has loomed over our digital life since 1989. Criminals use this type of cyber attack to lock or encrypt victims' data, often coercing them to pay exorbitant amounts in ransom. The damage ransomware causes ranges from monetary losses paid for ransom at best to endangering human lives. Cryptographic ransomware, where attackers encrypt the victim's data, stands as the predominant ransomware variant. The primary characteristics of these attacks have remained the same since the first ransomware attack. For this reason, we consider this a key factor differentiating ransomware from other cyber attacks, making it vital in tackling the threat of cryptographic ransomware. This paper proposes a cyber kill chain that describes the modern crypto-ransomware attack. The survey focuses on the Encryption phase as described in our proposed cyber kill chain and its detection techniques. We identify three main methods used in detecting encryption-related activities by ransomware, namely API and System calls, I/O monitoring, and file system activities monitoring. Machine learning (ML) is a tool used in all three identified methodologies, and some of the issues within the ML domain related to this survey are also covered as part of their respective methodologies. The survey of selected proposals is conducted through the prism of those three methodologies, showcasing the importance of detecting ransomware during pre-encryption and encryption activities and the windows of opportunity to do so. We also examine commercial crypto-ransomware protection and detection offerings and show the gap between academic research and commercial applications.",

Unfortunately, not any recovery tool can effectively defend various types of ransomware. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ransomware defense mechanism that can be easily deployed in modern Windows system to recover the data and mitigate a ransomware attack. The uniqueness of our approach is to fight the virus like a virus. We leverage Alternative Data Streams which are sometimes used by malicious applications, to develop a data protection method that misleads the ransomware to attack only file 'shells' instead of the actual file content.

However, as certain variants of malware can provide highly lucrative opportunities for bad actors, significant resources are dedicated to innovations and improvements by vast criminal organisations. Among these forms of malware, ransomware has experienced a significant recent rise as it offers the perpetrators great financial incentive. Ransomware variants operate by removing system access from the user by either locking the system or encrypting some or all of the data, and subsequently demanding payment or ransom in exchange for returning system access or providing a decryption key to the victim. Due to the ubiquity of sensitive data in many aspects of modern life, many victims of such attacks, be they an individual home user or operators of a business, are forced to pay the ransom to regain access to their data, which in many cases does not happen as renormalisation of system operations is never guaranteed. As the problem of ransomware does not seem to be subsiding, it is very important to investigate the underlying forces driving and facilitating such attacks in order to create preventative measures. As such, in this paper, we discuss and provide further insight into variants of ransomware and their victims in order to understand how and why they have been targeted and what can be done to prevent or mitigate the effects of such attacks.",

However, the increased online presence also exposes sensitive data exchanged between citizens and service providers to a wider range of security threats. Therefore, ensuring the security and trustworthiness of online services is crucial to Electronic Government (EGOV) initiatives' success. Hence, this work assesses the security posture of online platforms hosted in 3068 governmental domain names, across all UN Member States, in three dimensions: support for secure communication protocols; the trustworthiness of their digital certificate chains; and services' exposure to known vulnerabilities. The results indicate that despite its rapid development, the public sector still falls short in adopting international standards and best security practices in services and infrastructure management. This reality poses significant risks to citizens and services across all regions and income levels.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the potential of crowdfunding as a tool for achieving citizen co-funding of public projects. Focusing on philanthropic crowdfunding, we examine whether collaborative projects between public and private organizations are more successful in fundraising than projects initiated solely by private organizations. We argue that government involvement in crowdfunding provides some type of accreditation or certification that attests to a project aim to achieve public rather than private goals, thereby mitigating information asymmetry and improving mutual trust between creators (i.e., private sector organizations) and funders (i.e., crowd). To support this argument, we show that crowdfunding projects with government involvement achieved a greater success rate and attracted a greater amount of funding than comparable projects without government involvement. This evidence shows that governments may take advantage of crowdfunding to co-fund public projects with the citizenry for addressing the complex challenges that we face in the twenty-first century.",
