      "abstract": "We show the security risk associated with using machine learning classifiers in United States election tabulators. The central classification task in election tabulation is deciding whether a mark does or does not appear on a bubble associated to an alternative in a contest on the ballot. Barretto et al. (E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.   Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.",

      "abstract": "Constructing efficient risk-limiting audits (RLAs) for multiwinner single transferable vote (STV) elections is a challenging problem. An STV RLA is designed to statistically verify that the reported winners of an election did indeed win according to the voters' expressed preferences and not due to mistabulation or interference, while limiting the risk of accepting an incorrect outcome to a desired threshold (the risk limit). Existing methods have shown that it is possible to form RLAs for two-seat STV elections in the context where the first seat has been awarded to a candidate in the first round of tabulation. This is called the first winner criterion. We present an assertion-based approach to conducting full or partial RLAs for STV elections with three or more seats, in which the first winner criterion is satisfied. Although the chance of forming a full audit that verifies all winners drops substantially as the number of seats increases, we show that we can quite often form partial audits that verify most, and sometimes all, of the reported winners. We evaluate our method on a dataset of over 500 three- and four-seat STV elections from the 2017 and 2022 local council elections in Scotland.",

This paper develops two propositions to ensure efficiency, fairness, resilience, and security. The first is to leverage Physical Internet (PI) principles, notably setting up a \"secure election physical intranet\" (SEPI) based on open resource sharing and flow consolidation between election facilities in the territory. The second is to adopt a smart dynamic resource allocation methodology within the SEPI based on queueing networks and lexicographic optimization. A queueing model is developed to provide feasible combinations of resources and individual performances for each polling location by considering layout and utilization constraints. A two-stage lexicographic optimizer receives the queueing model's outputs and finds an optimal solution that is less expensive, fast, and fair. A scenario-based case study validates the proposed methodology based on data from the 2020 US Presidential Election in Fulton County, Georgia, USA.",

Traditional voting methods face growing risks of tampering, making it crucial to explore innovative solutions. Our proposed system combines blockchain's immutable, decentralized ledger with advanced voter identity verification techniques, including digital identity validation through Aadhaar and Driving Licenses (secured via BLAKE2b-512 hashing), biometric fingerprint authentication, and a picture rotation pattern for added security. Votes are recorded transparently and securely on a blockchain, with a consensus mechanism ensuring data integrity and reducing the risk of unauthorized alterations. Security analysis indicates that this multi-layered approach significantly reduces impersonation risks, while blockchain ensures accurate, private, and tamper-resistant vote recording. The findings support that a blockchain-based voting system with robust identity checks offers a trustworthy alternative to traditional methods, with potential for even greater refinement in secure and transparent elections.",

      "abstract": "The single transferable vote (STV) is a system of preferential proportional voting employed in multi-seat elections. Each ballot cast by a voter is a (potentially partial) ranking over a set of candidates. The margin of victory, or simply 'margin', is the smallest number of ballots that need to be manipulated to alter the set of winners. Knowledge of the margin of an election gives greater insight into both how much time and money should be spent on auditing the election, and whether uncovered mistakes throw the election result into doubt -- requiring a costly repeat election -- or can be safely ignored without compromising the integrity of the result. Lower bounds on the margin can also be used for this purpose, in cases where exact margins are difficult to compute. There is one existing approach to computing lower bounds on the margin of STV elections, while there are multiple approaches to finding upper bounds. In this paper, we present improvements to this existing lower bound computation method for STV margins. The improvements lead to increased computational efficiency and, in many cases, to the algorithm computing tighter (higher) lower bounds.",

The enunciated motivation for the protocol is to allow (electronic) votes from overseas military voters to be included in preliminary results before a (paper) ballot is received from the voter. MERGE contains interesting ideas that are not inherently unsound; but to make the system trustworthy--to apply the MERGE protocol--would require major changes to the laws, practices, and technical and logistical abilities of U.S. election jurisdictions. The gap between theory and practice is large and unbridgeable for the foreseeable future. Promoters of this research project at DARPA, the agency that sponsored the research, should acknowledge that MERGE is internet voting (election results rely on votes transmitted over the internet except in the event of a full hand count) and refrain from claiming that it could be a component of trustworthy elections without sweeping changes to election law and election administration throughout the U.S.",

This paper addresses these issues by introducing a dynamic mathematical modeling framework for performing a risk assessment of VBM processes. We introduce a discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) to model the VBM process and assess election performance and risk with a novel layered network approach that considers the interplay between VBM processes, malicious and non-malicious threats, and security mitigations. The time-inhomogeneous DTMC framework captures dynamic risks and evaluates performance over time. The DTMC model accounts for a spectrum of outcomes, from unintended voter errors to sophisticated, targeted attacks, representing a significant advancement in the risk assessment of VBM planning and protection. A case study based on real-world data from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is used to evaluate the DTMC model. The analysis includes the development of attack scenarios and the evaluation of security measures, to illustrate the impact of different attack timings. The analysis suggests that ballot drop boxes and automatic ballot notification systems are crucial for ensuring secure and reliable operations.",

In the technology age, this can be solved with a Smartcard National ID backed by Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI). This could be a method to restore hope in democracy and move the country back towards elections under a Popular Vote.

      "abstract": "Various risk-limiting audit (RLA) methods have been developed for instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections. A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first efficient approach that can take advantage of but does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test statistics, essentially \"learning\" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes and parameter settings.   We explore schemes and settings more extensively, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practice. We focus on the case where CVRs are not available, assessing performance using simulations based on real election data.   The most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent \"best\" hypotheses based on already seen data. Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed.   A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to a small number of candidates -- up to six in previous implementations. One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially compromising statistical performance.",

      "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are techniques for verifying the outcomes of large elections. While they provide rigorous guarantees of correctness, widespread adoption has been impeded by both efficiency concerns and the fact they offer statistical, rather than absolute, conclusions. We attend to both of these difficulties, defining new families of audits that improve efficiency and offer qualitative advances in statistical power.   Our new audits are enabled by revisiting the standard notion of a cast-vote record so that it can declare multiple possible mark interpretations rather than a single decision; this can reflect the presence of marginal marks, which appear regularly on hand-marked ballots. We show that this simple expedient can offer significant efficiency improvements with only minor changes to existing auditing infrastructure. We consider two ways of representing these marks, both yield risk-limiting comparison audits in the formal sense of Fuller, Harrison, and Russell (IEEE Security & Privacy 2023).   We then define a new type of post-election audit we call a contested audit. These permit each candidate to provide a cast-vote record table advancing their own claim to victory. We prove that these audits offer remarkable sample efficiency, yielding control of risk with a constant number of samples (that is independent of margin). This is a first for an audit with provable soundness. These results are formulated in a game-based security model that specify quantitative soundness and completeness guarantees. These audits provide a means to handle contestation of election results affirmed by conventional RLAs.",

Votes over the quota have their value reduced by a transfer value so as to remove the quota, and are passed to the next candidate on the ballot. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are a statistically sound approach to election auditing which guarantees that failure to detect an error in the result is bounded by a limit. A first approach to RLAs for 2-seat STV elections has been defined.

Ballot stuffing is the attack where fake ballots (not cast by any eligible voter) are inserted into the system. Participation privacy is about hiding which eligible voters have actually cast their vote. So far, the combination of ballot stuffing and participation privacy has been mostly studied for internet voting, where voters are assumed to own trusted computing devices. Such approaches are inapplicable to pollsite voting where voters typically vote bare handed. We present an eligibility audit protocol to detect ballot stuffing in pollsite voting protocols. This is done while protecting participation privacy from a remote observer - one who does not physically observe voters during voting. Our protocol can be instantiated as an additional layer on top of most existing pollsite E2E-V voting protocols. To achieve our guarantees, we develop an efficient zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), that, given a value $v$ and a set $\\Phi$ of commitments, proves $v$ is committed by some commitment in $\\Phi$, without revealing which one. We call this a ZKP of reverse set membership because of its relationship to the popular ZKPs of set membership. This ZKP may be of independent interest.",

Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot. But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks. But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards. The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and retrieval were accurate.",

      "abstract": "Electronic voting consistently fails to supplant conventional paper ballot due to a plethora of security shortcomings. Not only are traditional voting methods mediocre in terms of convenience and interface, they also encompass principal-agent problem, where the state may have vested interest in the outcome of the ballot. Electronic voting protocol using cryptography to deliver in zero trust environments is long overdue. Here I propose using Proof of Work algorithm at user devices in combination with other well-known security primitives to build a zero-trust voting system. The state would only issue single-use voting authorizations to its citizens, while zero trust design would allow conducting elections by an open-source platform with enhanced observability. It is also hypothesized that the heighten availability of plebiscite by means of the proposed design may ultimately change the way our society participates in the policy making.",

We present a new approach to auditing ranked systems that uses a statistical model, a Dirichlet-tree, that can cope with high-dimensional parameters in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate this approach with a ballot-polling Bayesian audit for IRV elections.

The technique we develop, based on standard regression analysis, makes use of the fact that vote share is correlated with demographics. We apply our method to the results of the 2020 US presidential election as a proof-of-concept, resulting in uncertainties at the few-percent level.

The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V) pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their (P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",

Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a deadlock from occurring if a minority of candidates or observers tries to sabotage the election. Candidates and observers can indicate that the election was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter, their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",

Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections.

One vulnerability, the result of including analytics software from an insecure external server, exposed some votes to complete compromise of privacy and integrity. At least one parliamentary seat was decided by a margin much smaller than the number of votes taken while the system was vulnerable.

      "abstract": "This note provides an introduction to the PPATS Commitment Consistent Encryption (CCE) scheme proposed by Cuvelier, Pereira and Peters and its use in the design of end-to-end verifiable elections with a perfectly private audit trail. These elections can be verified using audit data that will never leak any information about the vote, even if all the private keys of the elections are compromised, or if the cryptographic assumptions are broken.",

      "abstract": "Voter control problems model situations such as an external agent trying to affect the result of an election by adding voters, for example by convincing some voters to vote who would otherwise not attend the election. Traditionally, voters are added one at a time, with the goal of making a distinguished alternative win by adding a minimum number of voters. In this paper, we initiate the study of combinatorial variants of control by adding voters: In our setting, when we choose to add a voter~$v$, we also have to add a whole bundle $\\kappa(v)$ of voters associated with $v$. We study the computational complexity of this problem for two of the most basic voting rules, namely the Plurality rule and the Condorcet rule.",

      "abstract": "In an electronic voting protocol, a distributed scheme can be used for forbidding the malicious acts of the voting administrator and the counter during the election, but it cannot prevent them from collaborating to trace the ballots and destroy their privacy after the election. We present a distributed anonymous quantum key distribution scheme and further construct a distributed quantum election scheme with a voting administrator made up of more than one part. This quantum election scheme can resist the malicious acts of the voting administrator and the counter after the election and can work in a system with lossy and noisy quantum channels.",

In response, in April of 2012, the authors, working with DeBeauvoir and her staff, jointly architected STAR-Vote, a voting system with a DRE-style human interface and a \"belt and suspenders\" approach to verifiability. It provides both a paper trail and end-to-end cryptography using COTS hardware. It is designed to support both ballot-level risk-limiting audits, and auditing by individual voters and observers. The human interface and process flow is based on modern usability research. This paper describes the STAR-Vote architecture, which could well be the next-generation voting system for Travis County and perhaps elsewhere.",

      "abstract": "SOBA is an approach to election verification that provides observers with justifiably high confidence that the reported results of an election are consistent with an audit trail (\"ballots\"), which can be paper or electronic. SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy; (2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy. Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials. Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the \"super-simple simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit.\" Step (3) is designed to reveal relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official and final.",

      "authors": [

      ],
      "abstract": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful. This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations (lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes, is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",
