      "abstract": "An election audit is risk-limiting if the audit limits (to a pre-specified threshold) the chance that an erroneous electoral outcome will be certified. Extant methods for auditing instant-runoff voting (IRV) elections are either not risk-limiting or require cast vote records (CVRs), the voting system's electronic record of the votes on each ballot. CVRs are not always available, for instance, in jurisdictions that tabulate IRV contests manually.   We develop an RLA method (AWAIRE) that uses adaptively weighted averages of test supermartingales to efficiently audit IRV elections when CVRs are not available. The adaptive weighting 'learns' an efficient set of hypotheses to test to confirm the election outcome. When accurate CVRs are available, AWAIRE can use them to increase the efficiency to match the performance of existing methods that require CVRs.   We provide an open-source prototype implementation that can handle elections with up to six candidates. Simulations using data from real elections show that AWAIRE is likely to be efficient in practice. We discuss how to extend the computational approach to handle elections with more candidates.   Adaptively weighted averages of test supermartingales are a general tool, useful beyond election audits to test collections of hypotheses sequentially while rigorously controlling the familywise error rate.",

VVPATs provide evidence that each vote was recorded as the voter intended, without having to trust the perfection or security of the EVMs.   However, confidence in election results requires more: VVPATs must be preserved inviolate and then actually used to check the reported election result in a trustworthy way that the public can verify. A full manual tally from the VVPATs could be prohibitively expensive and time-consuming; moreover, it is difficult for the public to determine whether a full hand count was conducted accurately. We show how Risk-Limiting Audits (RLAs) could provide high confidence in Indian election results. Compared to full hand recounts, RLAs typically require manually inspecting far fewer VVPATs when the outcome is correct, and are much easier for the electorate to observe in adequate detail to determine whether the result is trustworthy.",

      "abstract": "The existing system for determining election results in Australia is, for the most part, secure, accurate and understandable by the average voter. This thesis explores the design of electronic voting systems designed to achieve these same goals, while also improving on the existing system in the areas of counting speed, accuracy, tamper resistance and accessibility.   Electronic voting systems have seen limited use within Australian elections, most prominently for State Elections in Victoria (2014), New South Wales (2015) and Western Australia (2017), along with trials of electronic voting systems in federal elections in 2007.   This thesis presents an analysis of the iVote electronic voting system used for the 2017 Western Australian State Election (iVote WA), outlining a number of security risks introduced by the use of cloud-based distributed denial of service mitigation. In addition, this thesis presents the results of a cross-sectional survey of Australian voters regarding levels of trust for three voting systems: the existing paper-based system used for Australian federal elections, the iVote WA system, and the vVote system used for the 2014 Victorian State Election.   The analysis of iVote, combined with the survey results, are used to inform a recommendation for future research and public policy regarding the use of electronic voting systems in Australian federal elections.",

      "abstract": "A boardroom election is an election that takes place in a single room -- the boardroom -- in which all voters can see and hear each other. We present an initial exploration of boardroom elections with ballot privacy and voter verifiability that use only \"low-tech cryptography\" without using computers to mark or collect ballots. Specifically, we define the problem, introduce several building blocks, and propose a new protocol that combines these blocks in novel ways. Our new building blocks include \"foldable ballots\" that can be rotated to hide the alignment of ballot choices with voting marks, and \"visual secrets\" that are easy to remember and use but hard to describe. Although closely seated participants in a boardroom election have limited privacy, the protocol ensures that no one can determine how others voted. Moreover, each voter can verify that their ballot was correctly cast, collected, and counted, without being able to prove how they voted, providing assurance against undue influence. Low-tech cryptography is useful in situations where constituents do not trust computer technology, and it avoids the complex auditing requirements of end-to-end cryptographic voting systems such as Pr\\^{e}t-\\`{a}-Voter. This paper's building blocks and protocol are meant to be a proof of concept that might be tested for usability and improved.",

      "authors": [
        "Philip B. Stark"
      ],
      "abstract": "Georgia was central to efforts to overturn the 2020 Presidential election, including a call from then-president Trump to Georgia Secretary of State Raffensperger asking Raffensperger to `find' 11,780 votes. Raffensperger has maintained that a `100% full-count risk-limiting audit' and a machine recount agreed with the initial machine-count results, which proved that the reported election results were accurate and that `no votes were flipped.' There is no indication of widespread fraud, but there is reason to distrust the election outcome: the two machine counts and the manual `audit' tallies disagree substantially, even about the number of ballots cast. Some ballots in Fulton County were included in the original count at least twice; some were included in the machine recount at least thrice. Audit results for some tally batches were omitted from the reported audit totals. The two machine counts and the audit were not probative of who won because of poor processes and controls: a lack of secure physical chain of custody, ballot accounting, pollbook reconciliation, and accounting for other election materials such as memory cards. Moreover, most voters voted with demonstrably untrustworthy ballot-marking devices, so even a perfect handcount or audit would not necessarily reveal who really won. True risk-limiting audits (RLAs) and rigorous recounts can limit the risk that an incorrect electoral outcome will be certified rather than being corrected. But no procedure can limit that risk without a trustworthy record of the vote. And even a properly conducted RLA of some contests in an election does not show that any other contests in that election were decided correctly. The 2020 U.S. Presidential election in Georgia illustrates unrecoverable errors that can render recounts and audits `security theater' that distract from the more serious problems rather than justifying trust.",

      "abstract": "Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is used in several countries around the world. It requires voters to rank candidates in order of preference, and uses a counting algorithm that is more complex than systems such as first-past-the-post or scoring rules. An even more complex system, the single transferable vote (STV), is used when multiple candidates need to be elected. The complexity of these systems has made it difficult to audit the election outcomes. There is currently no known risk-limiting audit (RLA) method for STV, other than a full manual count of the ballots.   A new approach to auditing these systems was recently proposed, based on a Dirichlet-tree model. We present a detailed analysis of this approach for ballot-polling Bayesian audits of IRV elections. We compared several choices for the prior distribution, including some approaches using a Bayesian bootstrap (equivalent to an improper prior). Our findings include that the bootstrap-based approaches can be adapted to perform similarly to a full Bayesian model in practice, and that an overly informative prior can give counter-intuitive results. Via carefully chosen examples, we show why creating an RLA with this model is challenging, but we also suggest ways to overcome this.   As well as providing a practical and computationally feasible implementation of a Bayesian IRV audit, our work is important in laying the foundation for an RLA for STV elections.",

      "abstract": "Counting votes is complex and error-prone. Several statistical methods have been developed to assess election accuracy by manually inspecting randomly selected physical ballots. Two 'principled' methods are risk-limiting audits (RLAs) and Bayesian audits (BAs). RLAs use frequentist statistical inference while BAs are based on Bayesian inference. Until recently, the two have been thought of as fundamentally different.   We present results that unify and shed light upon 'ballot-polling' RLAs and BAs (which only require the ability to sample uniformly at random from all cast ballot cards) for two-candidate plurality contests, which are building blocks for auditing more complex social choice functions, including some preferential voting systems. We highlight the connections between the methods and explore their performance.   First, building on a previous demonstration of the mathematical equivalence of classical and Bayesian approaches, we show that BAs, suitably calibrated, are risk-limiting. Second, we compare the efficiency of the methods across a wide range of contest sizes and margins, focusing on the distribution of sample sizes required to attain a given risk limit. Third, we outline several ways to improve performance and show how the mathematical equivalence explains the improvements.",

      "abstract": "We present a system for running auditable and verifiable elections in untrusted environments. Votes are anonymous since the order of candidates on a ballot sheet is random. Tellers see only the position of the candidate. Voters can check their vote. An election is auditable using blockchain log. Threshold-encryption, which is used to implement the quorum, prevents a deadlock from occurring if a minority of candidates or observers tries to sabotage the election. Candidates and observers can indicate that the election was free and fair by exposing their keys, which are used by the system to decrypt each vote. Ballot sheets are encrypted by onion-routing, which has a layer with the key of the election instance, so it's impossible for a quorum to decode the results before they have announced their decision by exposing their keys. A register of voters ensures that only verified voters can vote without compromising their identity. If there any doubts about the identity of a voter, their vote can be excluded from the election, if a quorum agrees. This system is designed to scale from one instance to a distributed system that runs over an unlimited number of instances, which can be achieved using cloud instances or smartphones belonging to voters or tellers.",

We apply our method to the results of the 2020 US presidential election as a proof-of-concept, resulting in uncertainties at the few-percent level.

The time-inhomogeneous DTMC framework captures dynamic risks and evaluates performance over time. The DTMC model accounts for a spectrum of outcomes, from unintended voter errors to sophisticated, targeted attacks, representing a significant advancement in the risk assessment of VBM planning and protection. A case study based on real-world data from Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, is used to evaluate the DTMC model. The analysis includes the development of attack scenarios and the evaluation of security measures, to illustrate the impact of different attack timings. The analysis suggests that ballot drop boxes and automatic ballot notification systems are crucial for ensuring secure and reliable operations.",

      "abstract": "Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful. This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations (lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes, is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",

Traditionally, this has been achieved by permitting voters to cast at most one ballot. More recently, this has been achieved by tallying the last ballot cast by each voter.

Moreover, we show how the adversary can choose the contents of such a ballot, thus the adversary can unduly influence the selection of representatives.",

The most widely used election of this type is Instant-Runoff Voting (IRV), where candidates are eliminated one by one, until a single candidate holds the majority of the remaining ballots. Condorcet elections treat the election as a set of simultaneous decisions about each pair of candidates. The Condorcet winner is the candidate who beats all others in these pairwise contests. There are various proposals to determine a winner if no Condorcet winner exists. In this paper we show how we can efficiently audit Condorcet elections for a number of variations. We also compare the audit efficiency (how many ballots we expect to sample) of IRV and Condorcet elections.",

An STV RLA is designed to statistically verify that the reported winners of an election did indeed win according to the voters' expressed preferences and not due to mistabulation or interference, while limiting the risk of accepting an incorrect outcome to a desired threshold (the risk limit). Existing methods have shown that it is possible to form RLAs for two-seat STV elections in the context where the first seat has been awarded to a candidate in the first round of tabulation. This is called the first winner criterion. We present an assertion-based approach to conducting full or partial RLAs for STV elections with three or more seats, in which the first winner criterion is satisfied. Although the chance of forming a full audit that verifies all winners drops substantially as the number of seats increases, we show that we can quite often form partial audits that verify most, and sometimes all, of the reported winners. We evaluate our method on a dataset of over 500 three- and four-seat STV elections from the 2017 and 2022 local council elections in Scotland.",

There is one existing approach to computing lower bounds on the margin of STV elections, while there are multiple approaches to finding upper bounds.

SOBA combines three ideas: (1) publishing cast vote records (CVRs) separately for each contest, so that anyone can verify that each reported contest outcome is correct, if the CVRs reflect voters' intentions with sufficient accuracy; (2) shrouding a mapping between ballots and the CVRs for those ballots to prevent the loss of privacy that could occur otherwise; (3) assessing the accuracy with which the CVRs reflect voters' intentions for a collection of contests while simultaneously assessing the integrity of the shrouded mapping between ballots and CVRs by comparing randomly selected ballots to the CVRs that purport to represent them. Step (1) is related to work by the Humboldt County Election Transparency Project, but publishing CVRs separately for individual contests rather than images of entire ballots preserves privacy. Step (2) requires a cryptographic commitment from elections officials. Observers participate in step (3), which relies on the \"super-simple simultaneous single-ballot risk-limiting audit.\" Step (3) is designed to reveal relatively few ballots if the shrouded mapping is proper and the CVRs accurately reflect voter intent. But if the reported outcomes of the contests differ from the outcomes that a full hand count would show, step (3) is guaranteed to have a large chance of requiring all the ballots to be counted by hand, thereby limiting the risk that an incorrect outcome will become official and final.",

Further, revelation is overwhelmingly concentrated among the few voters who cast provisional ballots or federal-only ballots.

In the technology age, this can be solved with a Smartcard National ID backed by Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI).

Votes are recorded transparently and securely on a blockchain, with a consensus mechanism ensuring data integrity and reducing the risk of unauthorized alterations. Security analysis indicates that this multi-layered approach significantly reduces impersonation risks, while blockchain ensures accurate, private, and tamper-resistant vote recording.

These vulnerabilities do not seem to have been detected by the election authorities before we disclosed them, despite a pre-election security review and despite the system having run in a live state election for five days. One vulnerability, the result of including analytics software from an insecure external server, exposed some votes to complete compromise of privacy and integrity.

Discrepancies are referred to as errors, and are used to build evidence against or in support of the recorded result. Risk-limiting audits for first-past-the-post elections are well understood, and used in some US elections. We define a number of approaches to ballot-polling and comparison risk-limiting audits for Instant Runoff Voting (IRV) elections.

      "abstract": "We present Phrase-Verified Voting, a voter-verifiable remote voting system assembled from commercial off-the-shelf software for small private elections. The system is transparent and enables each voter to verify that the tally includes their ballot selection without requiring any understanding of cryptography. This paper describes the system and its use in fall 2020, to vote remotely in promotion committees in a university. Each voter fills out a form in the cloud with their vote V (YES, NO, ABSTAIN) and a passphrase P-two words entered by the voter. The system generates a verification prompt of the (P,V) pairs and a tally of the votes, organized to help visualize how the votes add up. After the polls close, each voter verifies that this table lists their (P,V) pair and that the tally is computed correctly. The system is especially appropriate for any small group making sensitive decisions. Because the system would not prevent a coercer from demanding that their victim use a specified passphrase, it is not designed for applications where such malfeasance would be likely or go undetected. Results from 43 voters show that the system was well-accepted, performed effectively for its intended purpose, and introduced users to the concept of voter-verified elections. Compared to the commonly-used alternatives of paper ballots or voting by email, voters found the system easier to use, and that it provided greater privacy and outcome integrity.",

This paper develops two propositions to ensure efficiency, fairness, resilience, and security. The first is to leverage Physical Internet (PI) principles, notably setting up a \"secure election physical intranet\" (SEPI) based on open resource sharing and flow consolidation between election facilities in the territory. The second is to adopt a smart dynamic resource allocation methodology within the SEPI based on queueing networks and lexicographic optimization. A queueing model is developed to provide feasible combinations of resources and individual performances for each polling location by considering layout and utilization constraints. A two-stage lexicographic optimizer receives the queueing model's outputs and finds an optimal solution that is less expensive, fast, and fair. A scenario-based case study validates the proposed methodology based on data from the 2020 US Presidential Election in Fulton County, Georgia, USA.",

A recent method, AWAIRE, is the first efficient approach that can take advantage of but does not require cast vote records (CVRs). AWAIRE involves adaptively weighted averages of test statistics, essentially \"learning\" an effective set of hypotheses to test. However, the initial paper on AWAIRE only examined a few weighting schemes and parameter settings.   We explore schemes and settings more extensively, to identify and recommend efficient choices for practice. We focus on the case where CVRs are not available, assessing performance using simulations based on real election data.   The most effective schemes are often those that place most or all of the weight on the apparent \"best\" hypotheses based on already seen data. Conversely, the optimal tuning parameters tended to vary based on the election margin. Nonetheless, we quantify the performance trade-offs for different choices across varying election margins, aiding in selecting the most desirable trade-off if a default option is needed.   A limitation of the current AWAIRE implementation is its restriction to a small number of candidates -- up to six in previous implementations. One path to a more computationally efficient implementation would be to use lazy evaluation and avoid considering all possible hypotheses. Our findings suggest that such an approach could be done without substantially compromising statistical performance.",

The Selene mechanism can be applied to many e-voting schemes, but here we present an application to the polling station context, resulting in a voter-verifiable electronic tally with a paper audit trail. The system uses a smartcard-based public key system to provide the individual verification and universal eligibility verifiability.

      "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are techniques for verifying the outcomes of large elections. While they provide rigorous guarantees of correctness, widespread adoption has been impeded by both efficiency concerns and the fact they offer statistical, rather than absolute, conclusions. We attend to both of these difficulties, defining new families of audits that improve efficiency and offer qualitative advances in statistical power.   Our new audits are enabled by revisiting the standard notion of a cast-vote record so that it can declare multiple possible mark interpretations rather than a single decision; this can reflect the presence of marginal marks, which appear regularly on hand-marked ballots. We show that this simple expedient can offer significant efficiency improvements with only minor changes to existing auditing infrastructure. We consider two ways of representing these marks, both yield risk-limiting comparison audits in the formal sense of Fuller, Harrison, and Russell (IEEE Security & Privacy 2023).   We then define a new type of post-election audit we call a contested audit. These permit each candidate to provide a cast-vote record table advancing their own claim to victory. We prove that these audits offer remarkable sample efficiency, yielding control of risk with a constant number of samples (that is independent of margin). This is a first for an audit with provable soundness. These results are formulated in a game-based security model that specify quantitative soundness and completeness guarantees. These audits provide a means to handle contestation of election results affirmed by conventional RLAs.",

We investigate the resulting Stackelberg game for the case where votes are aggregated using two variants of the Plurality rule, and obtain an almost complete picture of the complexity landscape, both from the attacker's and from the defender's perspective.",

Here I propose using Proof of Work algorithm at user devices in combination with other well-known security primitives to build a zero-trust voting system. The state would only issue single-use voting authorizations to its citizens, while zero trust design would allow conducting elections by an open-source platform with enhanced observability.

Votes over the quota have their value reduced by a transfer value so as to remove the quota, and are passed to the next candidate on the ballot. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) are a statistically sound approach to election auditing which guarantees that failure to detect an error in the result is bounded by a limit. A first approach to RLAs for 2-seat STV elections has been defined.

(E-Vote-ID 2021) reported that convolutional neural networks are a viable option in this field, as they outperform simple feature-based classifiers.   Our contributions to election security can be divided into four parts. To demonstrate and analyze the hypothetical vulnerability of machine learning models on election tabulators, we first introduce four new ballot datasets. Second, we train and test a variety of different models on our new datasets. These models include support vector machines, convolutional neural networks (a basic CNN, VGG and ResNet), and vision transformers (Twins and CaiT). Third, using our new datasets and trained models, we demonstrate that traditional white box attacks are ineffective in the voting domain due to gradient masking. Our analyses further reveal that gradient masking is a product of numerical instability. We use a modified difference of logits ratio loss to overcome this issue (Croce and Hein, ICML 2020). Fourth, in the physical world, we conduct attacks with the adversarial examples generated using our new methods. In traditional adversarial machine learning, a high (50% or greater) attack success rate is ideal. However, for certain elections, even a 5% attack success rate can flip the outcome of a race. We show such an impact is possible in the physical domain. We thoroughly discuss attack realism, and the challenges and practicality associated with printing and scanning ballot adversarial examples.",

      "abstract": "Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) guarantee a high probability of correcting incorrect reported outcomes before the outcomes are certified. The most efficient use ballot-level comparison, comparing the voting system's interpretation of individual ballot cards sampled at random (cast-vote records, CVRs) from a trustworthy paper trail to a human interpretation of the same cards. Such comparisons require the voting system to create and export CVRs in a way that can be linked to the individual ballots the CVRs purport to represent. Such links can be created by keeping the ballots in the order in which they are scanned or by printing a unique serial number on each ballot. But for precinct-count systems (PCOS), these strategies may compromise vote anonymity: the order in which ballots are cast may identify the voters who cast them. Printing a unique pseudo-random number (\"cryptographic nonce\") on each ballot card after the voter last touches it could reduce such privacy risks. But what if the system does not in fact print a unique number on each ballot or does not accurately report the numbers it printed? This paper gives two ways to conduct an RLA so that even if the system does not print a genuine nonce on each ballot or misreports the nonces it used, the audit's risk limit is not compromised (however, the anonymity of votes might be compromised). One method allows untrusted technology to be used to imprint and to retrieve ballot cards. The method is adaptive: if the technology behaves properly, this protection does not increase the audit workload. But if the imprinting or retrieval system misbehaves, the sample size the RLA requires to confirm the reported results when the results are correct is generally larger than if the imprinting and retrieval were accurate.",
