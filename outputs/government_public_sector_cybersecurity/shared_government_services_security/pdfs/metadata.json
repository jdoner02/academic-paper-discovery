      "abstract": "A key countermeasure in cybersecurity has been the development of standardized computational protocols for modeling and sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) between organizations, enabling a shared understanding of threats and coordinated global responses. However, while the cybersecurity domain benefits from mature threat exchange frameworks, there has been little progress in the automatic and interoperable sharing of knowledge about disinformation campaigns. This paper proposes an open-source disinformation threat intelligence framework for sharing interoperable disinformation incidents. This approach relies on i) the modeling of disinformation incidents with the DISARM framework (MITRE ATT&CK-based TTP modeling of disinformation attacks), ii) a custom mapping to STIX2 standard representation (computational data format), and iii) an exchange architecture (called DISINFOX) capable of using the proposed mapping with a centralized platform to store and manage disinformation incidents and CTI clients which consume the gathered incidents. The microservice-based implementation validates the framework with more than 100 real-world disinformation incidents modeled, stored, shared, and consumed successfully. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first academic and technical effort to integrate disinformation threats in the CTI ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) sharing is an important activity to reduce information asymmetries between attackers and defenders. However, this activity presents challenges due to the tension between data sharing and confidentiality, that result in information retention often leading to a free-rider problem. Therefore, the information that is shared represents only the tip of the iceberg. Current literature assumes access to centralized databases containing all the information, but this is not always feasible, due to the aforementioned tension. This results in unbalanced or incomplete datasets, requiring the use of techniques to expand them; we show how these techniques lead to biased results and misleading performance expectations. We propose a novel framework for extracting CTI from distributed data on incidents, vulnerabilities and indicators of compromise, and demonstrate its use in several practical scenarios, in conjunction with the Malware Information Sharing Platforms (MISP). Policy implications for CTI sharing are presented and discussed. The proposed system relies on an efficient combination of privacy enhancing technologies and federated processing. This lets organizations stay in control of their CTI and minimize the risks of exposure or leakage, while enabling the benefits of sharing, more accurate and representative results, and more effective predictive and preventive defenses.",

In this paper, we try to develop a secure information sharing approach for digital government to improve home land security. This approach is a role and cooperation based approach for security personnel of different government departments. In order to run any successful digital government of any country in the world, it is necessary to interact with their citizen and to share secure information via different network among the citizen or other government. Consequently, in order to smooth the progress of users to cooperate with and share information without darkness and flawlessly transversely different networks and databases universally, a safe and trusted information-sharing environment has been renowned as a very important requirement and to press forward homeland security endeavor. The key incentive following this research is to put up a secure and trusted information-sharing approach for government departments. This paper presents a proficient function and teamwork based information sharing approach for safe exchange of hush-hush and privileged information amid security personnels and government departments inside the national boundaries by means of public key cryptography. The expanded approach makes use of cryptographic hash function; public key cryptosystem and a unique and complex mapping function for securely swapping over secret information. Moreover, the projected approach facilitates privacy preserving information sharing with probable restrictions based on the rank of the security personnels.",

Trusted partner organizations can provide access to past and current cybersecurity threats for reducing the risk of a potential cyberattack - the requirements for threat information sharing range from simplistic sharing of documents to threat intelligence sharing. Therefore, the storage and sharing of highly sensitive threat information raises considerable concerns regarding constructing a secure, trusted threat information exchange infrastructure. Establishing a trusted ecosystem for threat sharing will promote the validity, security, anonymity, scalability, latency efficiency, and traceability of the stored information that protects it from unauthorized disclosure. This paper proposes a system that ensures the security principles mentioned above by utilizing a distributed ledger technology that provides secure decentralized operations through smart contracts and provides a privacy-preserving ecosystem for threat information storage and sharing regarding the MITRE ATT\\&CK framework.",

However, there is a major concern regarding data privacy on these cloud-based platforms. This work presents novel cloud-based privacy-preserving solutions to support collaborative consumption applications for sharing economy. In typical collaborative consumption, information processing platforms need to enable fair cost-sharing among multiple users for utilizing certain shared facilities and communal services. Our cloud-based privacy-preserving protocols, based on homomorphic Paillier cryptosystems, can ensure that the cloud-based operator can only obtain an aggregate schedule of all users in facility sharing, or a service schedule conforming to service provision rule in communal service sharing, but is unable to track the personal schedules or demands of individual users. More importantly, the participating users are still able to settle cost-sharing among themselves in a fair manner for the incurred costs, without knowing each other's private schedules or demands. Our privacy-preserving protocols involve no other third party who may compromise privacy. We also provide an extensive evaluation study and a proof-of-concept system prototype of our protocols.",

      "abstract": "The rise of IT-dependent operations in modern organizations has heightened their vulnerability to cyberattacks. As a growing number of organizations include smart, interconnected devices in their systems to automate their processes, the attack surface becomes much bigger, and the complexity and frequency of attacks pose a significant threat. Consequently, organizations have been compelled to seek innovative approaches to mitigate the menaces inherent in their infrastructure. In response, considerable research efforts have been directed towards creating effective solutions for sharing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI). Current information-sharing methods lack privacy safeguards, leaving organizations vulnerable to leaks of both proprietary and confidential data. To tackle this problem, we designed a novel framework called SeCTIS (Secure Cyber Threat Intelligence Sharing), integrating Swarm Learning and Blockchain technologies to enable businesses to collaborate, preserving the privacy of their CTI data. Moreover, our approach provides a way to assess the data and model quality, and the trustworthiness of all the participants leveraging some validators through Zero Knowledge Proofs. An extensive experimental campaign demonstrates our framework's correctness and performance, and the detailed attack model discusses its robustness against attacks in the context of data and model quality.",

In May 2017, WannaCry infected more than 300,000 machines in 150 countries in a few days and had a large impact on critical infrastructure. Existing threat sharing platforms cannot easily adapt to emerging attack patterns. At the same time, enterprises started to adopt machine learning-based threat detection tools in their local networks. In this paper, we pose the question: \\emph{What information can defenders share across multiple networks to help machine learning-based threat detection adapt to new coordinated attacks?} We propose three information sharing methods across two networks, and show how the shared information can be used in a machine-learning network-traffic model to significantly improve its ability of detecting evasive self-propagating malware.",

Many cloud and blockchain platforms, as well as government initiatives, are interested in providing this type of service.   These cooperative efforts face a challenge, which we call ``exclusivity attacks''. A firm can share distorted data, so that it learns the best model fit, but is also able to mislead others. We study protocols for long-term interactions and their vulnerability to these attacks, in particular for regression and clustering tasks. We conclude that the choice of protocol, as well as the number of Sybil identities an attacker may control, is material to vulnerability.",

However, ZTA's dual nature as both technical infrastructure and social intervention creates an unresolved tension: its very mechanisms for security may systematically erode the trust foundations enabling effective collaboration. This integrative research combines case study analysis, employee surveys, and social network mapping reveals how ZTA disrupts knowledge-sharing, disproportionately hindering low-altruism employees, while surveillance erodes collective psychological ownership. Networked organizations, reliant on fluid trust, face fragmentation risks. Mitigation strategies include adaptive authorization frameworks using behavioral analytics and transparent communication reframing security as shared responsibility. Interdepartmental collaboration in security design preserves organizational trust structures identified through sociometric mapping. This research provides a framework balancing technical rigor with cultural sensitivity, proving cybersecurity can coexist with innovation by aligning verification with organizational psychology. The findings pioneer a paradigm where security and trust evolve synergistically critical for digital resilience in hybrid work environments.

      "abstract": "In recent years the cybersecurity policy debate in Washington has been dominated by calls for greater information sharing within the private sector, and between the private sector and the federal government. The passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) (signed into law under the Cybersecurity Act of 2015) underscored federal efforts to collect information from the private sector, and assuaged some concerns regarding private sector liability in sharing activities. However, the law lacked specificity on how continued federal efforts would work with existing information sharing networks, and failed to address other challenges associated with sharing including trust building, privacy and propriety interests, reciprocation, and quality control. This paper aims to bring granularity to implementations of information sharing initiatives by creating a taxonomy of the governance and policy models within each of these organizations. The research shows how this diverse ecosystem of sharing models work together and separately, and the impact governance and policy have on key components critical to sharing infrastructure.",

Using appropriate cryptographic tools, entities can estimate the benefits of collaboration and agree on what to share in a privacy-preserving way, without having to disclose their datasets. We focus on collaborative predictive blacklisting, i.e., forecasting attack sources based on one's logs and those contributed by other organizations. We study the impact of different sharing strategies by experimenting on a real-world dataset of two billion suspicious IP addresses collected from Dshield over two months. We find that controlled data sharing yields up to 105% accuracy improvement on average, while also reducing the false positive rate.",

      "abstract": "In a traditional cloud storage system, users benefit from the convenience it provides but also take the risk of certain security and privacy issues. To ensure confidentiality while maintaining data sharing capabilities, the Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-based Encryption (CP-ABE) scheme can be used to achieve fine-grained access control in cloud services. However, existing approaches are impaired by three critical concerns: illegal authorization, key disclosure, and privacy leakage.   To address these, we propose a blockchain-based data governance system that employs blockchain technology and attribute-based encryption to prevent privacy leakage and credential misuse. First, our ABE encryption system can handle multi-authority use cases while protecting identity privacy and hiding access policy, which also protects data sharing against corrupt authorities. Second, applying the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for data encryption makes the whole system efficient and responsive to real-world conditions. Furthermore, the encrypted data is stored in a decentralized storage system such as IPFS, which does not rely on any centralized service provider and is, therefore, resilient against single-point failures. Third, illegal authorization activity can be readily identified through the logged on-chain data. Besides the system design, we also provide security proofs to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed system.",

      "abstract": "Background: Open innovation highlights the potential benefits of external collaboration and knowledge-sharing, often exemplified through Open Source Software (OSS). The public sector has thus far mainly focused on the sharing of Open Government Data (OGD), often with a supply-driven approach with limited feedback-loops. We hypothesize that public sector organizations can extend the open innovation benefits by also creating platforms, where OGD, related OSS, and open standards are collaboratively developed and shared. Objective: The objective of this study is to explore how public sector organizations in the role of platform providers facilitate such collaboration in the form of OGD ecosystems and how the ecosystem's governance may be structured to support the collaboration. Method: We conduct an exploratory multiple-case study of two such ecosystems, focused on OGD related to the Swedish labor market and public transport sector, respectively. Data is gathered through interviews, document studies, and prolonged engagement at one of the platform providers. Results: The study presents governance structure and collaboration practices of the two ecosystems and discusses how these contribute to the platform providers' goals. The case studies highlight the need for platform providers to take an active and multi-functional role in enabling the sharing of data and software from and between the members of the ecosystem. Conclusions: We conclude that OGD ecosystems offer public sector organizations a possibility to catalyze the potential innovation output of OGD, but that it requires investment and adoption of an open and collaborative mindset.",

      "abstract": "Small and medium-sized enterprises are considered an essential part of the EU economy, however, highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. SMEs have specific characteristics which separate them from large companies and influence their adoption of good cybersecurity practices. To mitigate the SMEs' cybersecurity adoption issues and raise their awareness of cyber threats, we have designed a self-paced security assessment and capability improvement method, CYSEC. CYSEC is a security awareness and training method that utilises self-reporting questionnaires to collect companies' information about cybersecurity awareness, practices, and vulnerabilities to generate automated recommendations for counselling. However, confidentiality concerns about cybersecurity information have an impact on companies' willingness to share their information. Security information sharing decreases the risk of incidents and increases users' self-efficacy in security awareness programs. This paper presents the results of semi-structured interviews with seven chief information security officers of SMEs to evaluate the impact of online consent communication on motivation for information sharing. The results were analysed in respect of the Self Determination Theory. The findings demonstrate that online consent with multiple options for indicating a suitable level of agreement improved motivation for information sharing. This allows many SMEs to participate in security information sharing activities and supports security experts to have a better overview of common vulnerabilities.

However, current peer-to-peer information sharing systems work mostly on wired networks. With the growing number of communication-equipped mobile devices that can self-organize into infrastructure-less communication platform, namely mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs becomes a promising research area. In this paper, we propose a Region-Based structure that enables efficient and secure peer-to-peer information sharing over MANETs. The implementation shows that the proposed scheme is Secure, scalable, efficient, and adaptive to node mobility and provides Reliable information sharing.",

The cyber domain has inherent challenges that make traditional machine learning techniques problematic, specifically the need to learn continually evolving attacks through global collaboration while maintaining data privacy, and the varying resources available to network owners. We present a scheme to mitigate these difficulties through an architectural approach using community model sharing with a streaming analytic pipeline. Our streaming approach trains models incrementally as each log record is processed, thereby adjusting to concept drift resulting from changing attacks. Further, we designed a community sharing approach which federates learning through merging models without the need to share sensitive cyber-log data. Finally, by standardizing data and Machine Learning processes in a modular way, we provide network security operators the ability to manage cyber threat events and model sensitivity through community member and analytic method weighting in ways that are best suited for their available resources and data.",

      "abstract": "As cybercriminals scale up their operations to increase their profits or inflict greater harm, we argue that there is an equal need to respond to their threats by scaling up cybersecurity. To achieve this goal, we have to develop a co-productive approach towards data collection and sharing by overcoming the cybersecurity data sharing paradox. This is where we all agree on the definition of the problem and end goal (improving cybersecurity and getting rid of cybercrime), but we disagree about how to achieve it and fail to work together efficiently. At the core of this paradox is the observation that public interests differ from private interests. As a result, industry and law enforcement take different approaches to the cybersecurity problem as they seek to resolve incidents in their own interests, which manifests in different data sharing practices between both and also other interested parties, such as cybersecurity researchers. The big question we ask is can these interests be reconciled to develop an interdisciplinary approach towards co-operation and sharing data. In essence, all three will have to co-own the problem in order to co-produce a solution. We argue that a few operational models with good practices exist that provide guides to a possible solution, especially multiple third-party ownership organisations which consolidate, anonymise and analyse data. To take this forward, we suggest the practical solution of organising co-productive data collection on a sectoral basis, but acknowledge that common standards for data collection will also have to be developed and agreed upon. We propose an initial set of best practices for building collaborations and sharing data and argue that these best practices need to be developed and standardised in order to mitigate the paradox.",

We further show that similar incentives can be designed based on outcomes of a public rating/assessment system.",

Today, threat actors are highly motivated, persistent, and well-founded and operate in a coordinated manner to commit a diversity of attacks using various sophisticated tactics, techniques, and procedures. Given the risks these threats present, it has become clear that organizations need to collaborate and share cyber threat information (CTI) and use it to improve their security posture. In this paper, we present TRADE -- TRusted Anonymous Data Exchange -- a collaborative, distributed, trusted, and anonymized CTI sharing platform based on blockchain technology. TRADE uses a blockchain-based access control framework designed to provide essential features and requirements to incentivize and encourage organizations to share threat intelligence information. In TRADE, organizations can fully control their data by defining sharing policies enforced by smart contracts used to control and manage CTI sharing in the network. TRADE allows organizations to preserve their anonymity while keeping organizations fully accountable for their action in the network. Finally, TRADE can be easily integrated within existing threat intelligence exchange protocols - such as trusted automated exchange of intelligence information (TAXII) and OpenDXL, thereby allowing a fast and smooth technology adaptation.",

Data governance is a common approach to managing data, but it faces many challenges such as data silos, data consistency, privacy, security, and access control. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a comprehensive framework that integrates data trust in federated learning with InterPlanetary File System, blockchain, and smart contracts to facilitate secure and mutually beneficial data sharing while providing incentives, access control mechanisms, and penalizing any dishonest behavior. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model is effective in improving the accuracy of federated learning models while ensuring the security and fairness of the data-sharing process. The research paper also presents a decentralized federated learning platform that successfully trained a CNN model on the MNIST dataset using blockchain technology. The platform enables multiple workers to train the model simultaneously while maintaining data privacy and security. The decentralized architecture and use of blockchain technology allow for efficient communication and coordination between workers. This platform has the potential to facilitate decentralized machine learning and support privacy-preserving collaboration in various domains.",

      "abstract": "The report demonstrates the benefits (in terms of improved claims loss modeling) of harnessing the value of Federated Learning (FL) to learn a single model across multiple insurance industry datasets without requiring the datasets themselves to be shared from one company to another. The application of FL addresses two of the most pressing concerns: limited data volume and data variety, which are caused by privacy concerns, the rarity of claim events, the lack of informative rating factors, etc.. During each round of FL, collaborators compute improvements on the model using their local private data, and these insights are combined to update a global model. Such aggregation of insights allows for an increase to the effectiveness in forecasting claims losses compared to models individually trained at each collaborator. Critically, this approach enables machine learning collaboration without the need for raw data to leave the compute infrastructure of each respective data owner. Additionally, the open-source framework, OpenFL, that is used in our experiments is designed so that it can be run using confidential computing as well as with additional algorithmic protections against leakage of information via the shared model updates. In such a way, FL is implemented as a privacy-enhancing collaborative learning technique that addresses the challenges posed by the sensitivity and privacy of data in traditional machine learning solutions. This paper's application of FL can also be expanded to other areas including fraud detection, catastrophe modeling, etc., that have a similar need to incorporate data privacy into machine learning collaborations. Our framework and empirical results provide a foundation for future collaborations among insurers, regulators, academic researchers, and InsurTech experts.",

Are there compelling sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector? What products or services can be shared in tomorrow's Smart Grid? We begin by exploring sharing economy opportunities in the electricity sector, and discuss regulatory and technical obstacles to these opportunities. We then study the specific problem of a collection of firms sharing their electricity storage. We characterize equilibrium prices for shared storage in a spot market. We formulate storage investment decisions of the firms as a non-convex non-cooperative game. We show that under a mild alignment condition, a Nash equilibrium exists, it is unique, and it supports the social welfare. We discuss technology platforms necessary for the physical exchange of power, and market platforms necessary to trade electricity storage. We close with synthetic examples to illustrate our ideas.",

      "abstract": "A model of cloud services is emerging whereby a few trusted providers manage the underlying hardware and communications whereas many companies build on this infrastructure to offer higher level, cloud-hosted PaaS services and/or SaaS applications. From the start, strong isolation between cloud tenants was seen to be of paramount importance, provided first by virtual machines (VM) and later by containers, which share the operating system (OS) kernel. Increasingly it is the case that applications also require facilities to effect isolation and protection of data managed by those applications. They also require flexible data sharing with other applications, often across the traditional cloud-isolation boundaries; for example, when government provides many related services for its citizens on a common platform. Similar considerations apply to the end-users of applications. But in particular, the incorporation of cloud services within `Internet of Things' architectures is driving the requirements for both protection and cross-application data sharing.   These concerns relate to the management of data. Traditional access control is application and principal/role specific, applied at policy enforcement points, after which there is no subsequent control over where data flows; a crucial issue once data has left its owner's control by cloud-hosted applications and within cloud-services. Information Flow Control (IFC), in addition, offers system-wide, end-to-end, flow control based on the properties of the data. We discuss the potential of cloud-deployed IFC for enforcing owners' dataflow policy with regard to protection and sharing, as well as safeguarding against malicious or buggy software. In addition, the audit log associated with IFC provides transparency, giving configurable system-wide visibility over data flows. [...]",

While threat-related information sharing can be conducted through traditional information exchange methods, such as email communications etc., these methods are often weak in terms of their trustworthiness and privacy. Additionally, the absence of a trust infrastructure between different information-sharing domains also poses significant challenges. These challenges include redactment of information, the Right-to-be-forgotten, and access control to the information-sharing elements. These access issues could be related to time bounds, the trusted deletion of data, and the location of accesses. This paper presents an abstraction of a trusted information-sharing process which integrates Attribute-Based Encryption (ABE), Homomorphic Encryption (HE) and Zero Knowledge Proof (ZKP) integrated into a permissioned ledger, specifically Hyperledger Fabric (HLF). It then provides a protocol exchange between two threat-sharing agents that share encrypted messages through a trusted channel. This trusted channel can only be accessed by those trusted in the sharing and could be enabled for each data-sharing element or set up for long-term sharing.",

      "abstract": "The environmental impact of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) continues to grow, driven notably by increasing usage, rebound effects, and emerging demands. However, despite the virtual nature of its services, the sector remains inherently constrained by its materiality and cannot rely on an infinite pool of resources. As a result, the wide variety of supported services may need to be managed under stricter limits within hosting facilities in the future. Contrary to common assumptions, we show that tenants typically do not share computing resources, even in environments commonly perceived as mutualized, such as cloud platforms. Time-sharing has been progressively phased out for reasons of performance, security, predictability, and, perhaps more importantly, due to the decreasing cost of computing resources. This paper advocates for managing fewer physical resources by improving resource sharing between tenants. It represents a paradigm shift, moving beyond traditional time-sharing at the hardware level to a higher abstraction. This approach entails \"doing with fewer resources\" under conditions of \"reduced performance\". Nonetheless, enhancing the mutualization of infrastructure can reduce cluster sizes (through consolidation) and improve energy efficiency, with gains related to the accepted performance trade-off, a situation potentially more socially acceptable than eliminating services. We review the current state of the art, identify challenges and opportunities, propose interpretations of Time-Shared Computing, and outline key research directions.",

      "abstract": "High-impact and potentially dangerous capabilities can and should be broken down into early warning shots long before reaching red lines. Each of these early warning shots should correspond to a precursory capability. Each precursory capability sits on a spectrum indicating its proximity to a final high-impact capability, corresponding to a red line. To meaningfully detect and track capability progress, we propose a taxonomy of dangerous capability zones (a zoning taxonomy) tied to a staggered information exchange framework that enables relevant bodies to take action accordingly. In the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, signatories commit to sharing more detailed information with trusted actors, including an appointed body, as appropriate (Commitment VII). Building on our zoning taxonomy, this paper makes four recommendations for specifying information sharing as detailed in Commitment VII. (1) Precursory capabilities should be shared as soon as they become known through internal evaluations before deployment. (2) AI Safety Institutes (AISIs) should be the trusted actors appointed to receive and coordinate information on precursory components. (3) AISIs should establish adequate information protection infrastructure and guarantee increased information security as precursory capabilities move through the zones and towards red lines, including, if necessary, by classifying the information on precursory capabilities or marking it as controlled. (4) High-impact capability progress in one geographical region may translate to risk in other regions and necessitates more comprehensive risk assessment internationally. As such, AISIs should exchange information on precursory capabilities with other AISIs, relying on the existing frameworks on international classified exchanges and applying lessons learned from other regulated high-risk sectors.",

We study the benefits which the sharing brings in terms of resiliency, and show that, with the appropriate placement of a few active nodes, the mean service downtime can be reduced more than threefold by providing interoperator communication to as little as one optical network unit in one hundred. The implementation of the proposed idea can be carried out in stages when needed (the pay-as-you-grow deployment), and in those parts of the network where high service availability is needed most, e.g., in a business district. While the performance should expectedly increase, we show the resiliency is brought almost out of thin air by using redundant resources of different operators. We evaluated the service availability for 87400 networks with the relative standard error of the sample mean below 1%.",

      "abstract": "The data revolution holds significant promise for the health sector. Vast amounts of data collected from individuals will be transformed into knowledge, AI models, predictive systems, and best practices. One area of health that stands to benefit greatly is the genomic domain. Progress in AI, machine learning, and data science has opened new opportunities for genomic research, promising breakthroughs in personalized medicine. However, increasing awareness of privacy and cybersecurity necessitates robust solutions to protect sensitive data in collaborative research. This paper presents a practical deployment of a privacy-preserving framework for genomic research, developed in collaboration with Lynx$.$MD, a platform for secure health data collaboration. The framework addresses critical cybersecurity and privacy challenges, enabling the privacy-preserving sharing and analysis of genomic data while mitigating risks associated with data breaches. By integrating advanced privacy-preserving algorithms, the solution ensures the protection of individual privacy without compromising data utility. A unique feature of the system is its ability to balance trade-offs between data sharing and privacy, providing stakeholders tools to quantify privacy risks and make informed decisions. Implementing the framework within Lynx$.$MD involves encoding genomic data into binary formats and applying noise through controlled perturbation techniques. This approach preserves essential statistical properties of the data, facilitating effective research and analysis. Moreover, the system incorporates real-time data monitoring and advanced visualization tools, enhancing user experience and decision-making. The paper highlights the need for tailored privacy attacks and defenses specific to genomic data. Addressing these challenges fosters collaboration in genomic research, advancing personalized medicine and public health.",

Benefits from threat intelligence include increased situational awareness, efficiency in security operations, and improved prevention, detection, and response capabilities. To process, correlate, and analyze vast amounts of threat information and data and derive intelligence that can be shared and consumed in meaningful times, it is required to utilize structured, machine-readable formats that incorporate the industry-required expressivity while at the same time being unambiguous. To a large extent, this is achieved with technologies like ontologies, schemas, and taxonomies. This research evaluates the coverage and high-level conceptual expressivity of cyber-threat-intelligence-relevant ontologies, sharing standards, and taxonomies pertaining to the who, what, why, where, when, and how elements of threats and attacks in addition to courses of action and technical indicators. The results confirm that little emphasis has been given to developing a comprehensive cyber threat intelligence ontology, with existing efforts being not thoroughly designed, non-interoperable, ambiguous, and lacking proper semantics and axioms for reasoning.",

      "abstract": "This research foregrounds general practices in travel demand research, emphasizing the need to change our ways. A critical barrier preventing travel demand literature from effectively informing policy is the volume of publications without clear, consolidated benchmarks, making it difficult for researchers and policymakers to gather insights and use models to guide decision-making. By emphasizing reproducibility and open collaboration, we aim to enhance the reliability and policy relevance of travel demand research. We present a collaborative infrastructure for transit demand prediction models, focusing on their performance during highly dynamic conditions like the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from over 300 published papers, we develop an open-source infrastructure with five common methodologies and assess their performance under stable and dynamic conditions. We found that the prediction error for the LSTM deep learning approach stabilized at a mean arctangent absolute percentage error (MAAPE) of about 0.12 within 1.5 months, whereas other models continued to exhibit higher error rates even a year into the pandemic. If research practices had prioritized reproducibility before the COVID-19 pandemic, transit agencies would have had clearer guidance on the best forecasting methods and quickly identified those best suited for pandemic conditions to inform operations in response to changes in transit demand. The aim of this open-source codebase is to lower the barrier for other researchers to replicate, reproduce models and build upon findings. We encourage researchers to test their own modeling approaches on this benchmarking platform, challenge the analyses conducted in this paper, and develop model specifications that can outperform those evaluated here. Further, collaborative research approaches must be expanded across travel demand modeling if we wish to impact policy and planning.",

To this end, we devise a minimal architectural foundation for collaborative agentic AI, named Web of Agents, which is composed of four components: agent-to-agent messaging, interaction interoperability, state management, and agent discovery. Web of Agents adopts existing standards and reuses existing infrastructure where possible. With Web of Agents, we take the first but critical step toward interoperable agentic systems and offer a pragmatic path forward before ecosystem fragmentation becomes the norm.",

Such advents are expected to attract new players like content providers and verticals, increasing competitiveness in the telecom market. However, scalability and trust issues are expected to arise, given the criticality of ownership traceability and resource exchanging in a sharing ecosystem. To address that, we propose integrating blockchain technology for enabling mobile operators and other players to exchange RAN resources (e.g., infrastructure) in the form of virtual network functions (VNF) autonomously and dynamically. Blockchain will provide automation, robustness, trustworthiness, and reliability to mobile networks, thus bringing confidence to open RAN environments. In particular, we define a novel O-RAN-based blockchain-enabled architecture that allows automating RAN sharing procedures through either auction or marketplace-based mechanisms.

This work presents a model to analyse the benefits and drawbacks of information sharing among organizations that presents a certain level of dependency. The proposed model applies functional dependency network analysis to emulate attacks propagation and game theory for information sharing management.

      "abstract": "To ensure that social networks (e.g. opinion consensus, cooperative estimation, distributed learning and adaptation etc.) proliferate and efficiently operate, the participating agents need to collaborate with each other by repeatedly sharing information. However, sharing information is often costly for the agents while resulting in no direct immediate benefit for them. Hence, lacking incentives to collaborate, strategic agents who aim to maximize their own individual utilities will withhold rather than share information, leading to inefficient operation or even collapse of networks. In this paper, we develop a systematic framework for designing distributed rating protocols aimed at incentivizing the strategic agents to collaborate with each other by sharing information. The proposed incentive protocols exploit the ongoing nature of the agents' interactions to assign ratings and through them, determine future rewards and punishments: agents that have behaved as directed enjoy high ratings -- and hence greater future access to the information of others; agents that have not behaved as directed enjoy low ratings -- and hence less future access to the information of others. Unlike existing rating protocols, the proposed protocol operates in a distributed manner, online, and takes into consideration the underlying interconnectivity of agents as well as their heterogeneity. We prove that in many deployment scenarios the price of anarchy (PoA) obtained by adopting the proposed rating protocols is one. In settings in which the PoA is larger than one, we show that the proposed rating protocol still significantly outperforms existing incentive mechanisms such as Tit-for-Tat. Importantly, the proposed rating protocols can also operate efficiently in deployment scenarios where the strategic agents interact over time-varying network topologies where new agents join the network over time.",

Each processor has access to a subset of sources from a set of independent sources of \"shared\" randomness. We consider two cases -- in the \"omniscient coordinator setting\", the coordinator has access to all these sources of shared randomness, while in the \"oblivious coordinator setting\", it has access to none. All processors and the coordinator may privately randomize. In the omniscient coordinator setting, when the subsets at the processors are disjoint (individually shared randomness model), we characterize the rate of communication required from the coordinator to the processors over a multicast link. For the two-processor case, the optimal rate matches a special case of relaxed Wyner's common information proposed by Gastpar and Sula (2019), thereby providing an operational meaning to the latter. We also give an upper bound on the communication rate for the \"randomness-on-the-forehead\" model where each processor observes all but one source of randomness and we give an achievable strategy for the general case where the processors have access to arbitrary subsets of sources of randomness. Also, we consider a more general model where the processors observe components of correlated sources (with the coordinator observing all the components), where we characterize the communication rate when all the processors wish to output the same random sequence. In the oblivious coordinator setting, we completely characterize the trade-off region between the communication and shared randomness rates for the general case where the processors have access to arbitrary subsets of sources of randomness.",

However, current geopolitical tensions present a challenge for Singapore, which strives to retain its strategic autonomy by maintaining positive relations with all parties. Paradoxically, the rise of non-traditional security threats may pave the way for greater bilateral cooperation by allowing Singapore to position itself as a hub for cooperation on regional security issues in Southeast Asia at large. In such spirit, this paper recommends that the United States and Singapore do the following: 1) in defense technology, co-develop niche capabilities in C4ISR and unmanned systems with peacetime applications; 2) in cybersecurity, improve their domestic resilience against sophisticated nation-state actors while also building regional capacity to counter cybercrime in Southeast Asia; and 3) in biosecurity, strengthen regional epidemiological surveillance to brace against possible future pandemics.",

However, data representations face the threat of model inversion attacks. In this article, we formally define the collaborative learning scenario, and quantify data utility and privacy. Then we present ARS, a collaborative learning framework wherein users share representations of data to train models, and add imperceptible adversarial noise to data representations against reconstruction or attribute extraction attacks. By evaluating ARS in different contexts, we demonstrate that our mechanism is effective against model inversion attacks, and achieves a balance between privacy and utility. The ARS framework has wide applicability. First, ARS is valid for various data types, not limited to images. Second, data representations shared by users can be utilized in different tasks. Third, the framework can be easily extended to the vertical data partitioning scenario.",

However, sharing threat-related information have posed various risks to an organization that pertains to its security, privacy, and competitiveness. Given the coinciding benefits and risks of threat information sharing, some entities have adopted an elusive behavior of \"free-riding\" so that they can acquire the benefits of sharing without contributing much to the community. So far, understanding the effectiveness of sharing has been viewed from the perspective of the amount of information exchanged as opposed to its quality. In this paper, we introduce the notion of quality of indicators (\\qoi) for the assessment of the level of contribution by participants in information sharing for threat intelligence. We exemplify this notion through various metrics, including correctness, relevance, utility, and uniqueness of indicators. In order to realize the notion of \\qoi, we conducted an empirical study and taken a benchmark approach to define quality metrics, then we obtained a reference dataset and utilized tools from the machine learning literature for quality assessment. We compared these results against a model that only considers the volume of information as a metric for contribution, and unveiled various interesting observations, including the ability to spot low quality contributions that are synonym to free riding in threat information sharing.",

However, this trend's progress is fundamentally hindered, despite the fact that combining individual knowledge can significantly improve the relevance and quality of responses in specialized queries and make AI more professional at providing services. Two key bottlenecks are private data repositories' locality constraints and the need to maintain compatibility with mainstream search techniques, particularly Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing for high-dimensional vector spaces. In this work, we develop a secure and privacy-preserving aggregated approximate nearest neighbor search (SP-A$^2$NN) with HNSW compatibility under a threshold-based searchable sharing primitive. A sharable bitgraph structure is constructed and extended to support searches and dynamical insertions over shared data without compromising the underlying graph topology. The approach reduces the complexity of a search from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ compared to naive (undirected) graph-sharing approach when organizing graphs in the identical HNSW manner.   On the theoretical front, we explore a novel security analytical framework that incorporates privacy analysis via reductions. The proposed leakage-guessing proof system is built upon an entirely different interactive game that is independent of existing coin-toss game design. Rather than being purely theoretical, this system is rooted in existing proof systems but goes beyond them to specifically address leakage concerns and standardize leakage analysis -- one of the most critical security challenges with AI's rapid development.",

Its widespread use has led to the distribution of AI and its underlying data across many intelligent systems. In this light, it is crucial to utilize information in learning processes that are either distributed or owned by different entities. As a result, modern data-driven services have been developed to integrate distributed knowledge entities into their outcomes. In line with this goal, the latest AI models are frequently trained in a decentralized manner. Distributed learning involves multiple entities working together to make collective predictions and decisions. However, this collaboration can also bring about security vulnerabilities and challenges. This paper provides an in-depth survey on private knowledge sharing in distributed learning, examining various knowledge components utilized in leading distributed learning architectures. Our analysis sheds light on the most critical vulnerabilities that may arise when using these components in a distributed setting. We further identify and examine defensive strategies for preserving the privacy of these knowledge components and preventing malicious parties from manipulating or accessing the knowledge information. Finally, we highlight several key limitations of knowledge sharing in distributed learning and explore potential avenues for future research.",

      "abstract": "When a threat is observed, one of the most important challenges is to choose the most appropriate and adequate timely decisions in response to the current and near future situation in order to have the least consequences and costs. Making the appropriate and sufficient decisions requires knowing what situations the threat has engendered or may engender. In this paper, we propose a quantitative risk-based method called QR-SACP to calculate and project situational awareness in a network based on threat information sharing. In this method, we investigate a threat from different aspects and evaluate the threat's effects through dependency weight among a network's services. We calculate the definite effect of a threat on a service and the cascading propagation of the threat's definite effect on other dependent services to that service. In addition, we project the probability of a threat propagation or recurrence of the threat in other network services in three ways: procedurally, network connections and similar infrastructure or services. Experimental results demonstrate that the QR-SACP method can calculate and project definite and probable threats' effects across the entire network and reveal more details about the threat's current and near future situations.",
