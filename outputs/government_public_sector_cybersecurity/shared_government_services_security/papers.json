      "abstract": "In recent years the cybersecurity policy debate in Washington has been dominated by calls for greater information sharing within the private sector, and between the private sector and the federal government. The passage of the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act (CISA) (signed into law under the Cybersecurity Act of 2015) underscored federal efforts to collect information from the private sector, and assuaged some concerns regarding private sector liability in sharing activities. However, the law lacked specificity on how continued federal efforts would work with existing information sharing networks, and failed to address other challenges associated with sharing including trust building, privacy and propriety interests, reciprocation, and quality control. This paper aims to bring granularity to implementations of information sharing initiatives by creating a taxonomy of the governance and policy models within each of these organizations. The research shows how this diverse ecosystem of sharing models work together and separately, and the impact governance and policy have on key components critical to sharing infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "This paper mainly depicts the conceptual overview of vertical integration, semantic interoperability architecture such as Educational Sector Architectural Framework (ESAF) for New Zealand government and different interoperability framework solution for digital government. In this paper, we try to develop a secure information sharing approach for digital government to improve home land security. This approach is a role and cooperation based approach for security personnel of different government departments. In order to run any successful digital government of any country in the world, it is necessary to interact with their citizen and to share secure information via different network among the citizen or other government. Consequently, in order to smooth the progress of users to cooperate with and share information without darkness and flawlessly transversely different networks and databases universally, a safe and trusted information-sharing environment has been renowned as a very important requirement and to press forward homeland security endeavor. The key incentive following this research is to put up a secure and trusted information-sharing approach for government departments. This paper presents a proficient function and teamwork based information sharing approach for safe exchange of hush-hush and privileged information amid security personnels and government departments inside the national boundaries by means of public key cryptography. The expanded approach makes use of cryptographic hash function; public key cryptosystem and a unique and complex mapping function for securely swapping over secret information. Moreover, the projected approach facilitates privacy preserving information sharing with probable restrictions based on the rank of the security personnels.",

Digital Government interoperability, information sharing protocol and security are measured the key issue for achieving a refined stage of digital government.
