      "abstract": "Alterations in Heart Rate (HR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV) can reflect autonomic dysfunction associated with neurodegeneration. We investigate the influence of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) on HR and its variability measures in the Indian population by designing a complete signal processing pipeline to detect the R-wave peaks and compute HR and HRV features from ECG recordings of 10 seconds, for point-of-care applications. The study cohort involves 297 urban participants, among which 48.48% are male and 51.51% are female. From the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-III (ACE-III), MCI is detected in 19.19% of participants and the rest, 80.8% of them are cognitively healthy. Statistical features like central tendency (mean and root mean square (RMS) of the Normal-to-Normal (NN) intervals) and dispersion (standard deviation (SD) of all NN intervals (SDNN) and root mean square of successive differences of NN intervals (RMSSD)) of beat-to-beat intervals are computed. The Wilcoxon rank sum test reveals that mean of NN intervals (p = 0.0021), the RMS of NN intervals (p = 0.0014), the SDNN (p = 0.0192) and the RMSSD (p = 0.0206) values differ significantly between MCI and non-MCI classes, for a level of significance, 0.05. Machine learning classifiers like, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Discriminant Analysis (DA) and Naive Bayes (NB) driven by mean NN intervals, RMS, SDNN and RMSSD, show a high accuracy of 80.80% on each individual feature input. Individuals with MCI are observed to have comparatively higher HR than healthy subjects. HR and its variability can be considered as potential biomarkers for detecting MCI.",

We collect RR interval time series data from nearly 100 firefighter trainees that participated in a drill. We explore and compare three methods in order to perform unsupervised stress detection: 1) traditional K-Means clustering with engineered time and frequency domain features 2) convolutional autoencoders and 3) long short-term memory (LSTM) autoencoders, both trained on the raw RRI measurements combined with DBSCAN clustering and K-Nearest-Neighbors classification. We demonstrate that K-Means combined with engineered features is unable to capture meaningful structure within the data. On the other hand, convolutional and LSTM autoencoders tend to extract varying structure from the data pointing to different clusters with different sizes of clusters. We attempt at identifying the true stressed and normal clusters using the HRV markers of mental stress reported in the literature. We demonstrate that the clusters produced by the convolutional autoencoders consistently and successfully stratify stressed versus normal samples, as validated by several established physiological stress markers such as RMSSD, Max-HR, Mean-HR and LF-HF ratio.",

      "abstract": "Background and Objective: The connection between depression and autonomous nervous system (ANS) is well documented in scientific literature. Heart rate variability (HRV) is a rich source of information for studying the dynamics of this relation. Disturbed heart dynamics in depression seriously increases mortality risk. Technical sciences help improve early detection and monitoring and offer more accurate management of treatment. Based on advances in computational power, information theory, complex systems dynamics, and nonlinear analysis applied to physiological complexity, we can now turn to novel biomarkers extracted from electrophysiological signals. This work is a cross-sectional analysis with methodological commentary of application of nonlinear measures of HRV related to depression. Methods: We systematically searched online for papers exploring the connection of depression and HRV, using both conventional and nonlinear analysis. We scrutinized chosen publications and methodologically analyzed and compared them. Results: Sixty-seven publications on the connection of HRV measures and depression meeting our inclusion criteria are selected. The effectiveness of the applied methods of electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis are compared and discussed in the light of detection and prevention of depression-related cardiac diseases. Conclusions: It is clear that aberrated ANS dynamics can be detected via ECG analysis, where nonlinear measures show to be more sensitive and accurate than standard time and spectral ones. With the portable ECG devices and cloud-based telehealth applications, monitoring of outpatients could be done anytime anywhere. We appeal for early screening for cardiovascular abnormalities in depressive patients to prevent possible deleterious events.",

      "abstract": "A novel audio binaural stimulus that generates rotational perceptions of sound movement in brain at a particular predetermined frequency is referred as gyrosonics. The influence of gyrosonics on autonomic nervous system of healthy subjects has been examined by analyzing heart rate variability (HRV) in time- and frequency- domain. The M-lagged Poincare plot shows that the parameters SD1, SD2 and ratio SD12 (SD1/SD2) increases with lagged number M, and M-dependence is well described by Pade' approximant $\\chi \\frac{1+\\beta M}{1+\\gamma M}$ where values of $\\chi$, $\\beta$ and $ \\gamma$ depend on parameters SD1,SD2 and SD12. The values of these parameters for different M are augmented after gyrosonic stimulation. The slope and magnitude of curvature of SD1 and SD12 vs M plot increase considerably due to stimulation. The DFA analysis exhibits decrease in value of exponent $\\alpha$ due to stimulation. This stimulation results slower Heart rate, higher values of the standard deviation SD and the root-mean squared successive differences (RMSSD) in RR-interval. The spectral power of both low (LF) - and high (HF) - frequency go up due to the stimulation. The results suggest an improvement of the sympatho-vagal balance due to this novel audio stimulus.",

      "abstract": "Electrocardiography (ECG) plays a significant role in diagnosing heart-related issues, it provides, accurate, fast, and dependable insights into crucial parameters like QRS complex duration, the R-R interval, and the occurrence, amplitude, and duration of P, R, and T waves. However, utilizing ECG for prolonged monitoring poses challenges as it necessitates connecting multiple electrodes to the patient's body. This can be discomforting and disruptive, hampering the attainment of uninterrupted recordings. Ballistocardiography (BCG) emerges as a promising substitute for ECG, presenting a non-invasive technique for recording the heart's mechanical activity. BCG signals can be captured using sensors positioned beneath the bed, thereby providing enhanced comfort and convenience for long-term monitoring of the subject. In a recent study, researchers compared the heart rate variability (HRV) indices derived from simultaneously acquired ECG and BCG signals. Encouragingly, the BCG signal yielded satisfactory results similar to those obtained from ECG, implying that BCG holds potential as a viable alternative for prolonged monitoring. The findings of this study carry substantial implications for the advancement of innovative, non-invasive methods in monitoring heart health. BCG showcases the ability to offer a more comfortable and convenient alternative to ECG while retaining its capacity to deliver accurate and reliable cardiac information concerning a patient's condition.",

The detrended fluctuation exponent has a higher value for diabetic group. The auto-correlation function of the deviation of interbeat interval in diabetic group shows highly correlated pattern when compared to that of normal one.

      "abstract": "Objective: Heart rate variability (HRV) has been proven to be an important indicator of physiological status for numerous applications. Despite the progress and active developments made in HRV metric research over the last few decades, the representation of the heartbeat sequence upon which HRV is based has received relatively little attention. The recently introduced heart rate n-variability (HRnV) offers an alternative to R-to-R peak interval representations which complements conventional HRV analysis by considering HRV behavior on varying scales. Although HRnV has been shown to improve triage in pilot studies, there is currently no open and standard software to support future research of HRnV and its broader clinical applications. We aimed to develop an open, reliable, and easy to use software package implementing HRnV for further research and improvements of HRnV. This package has been designed to facilitate collaborative investigations between clinicians and researchers to study HRnV in various contexts and applications. Approach: We developed an open-source software, HRnV-Calc, based on the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox (PCST), which features comprehensive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for HRnV and HRV analysis. Main results: While preserving the core functionalities and performance of PCST, HRnV-Calc enables step-by-step manual inspection and configuration of HRV and HRnV analysis, so that results can be debugged, easily interpreted, and integrated to downstream applications. Significance: The open-source HRnV-Calc software, an accessible and standardized HRV and HRnV analysis platform, enhances the scope of HRV assessment and is designed to assist in future improvements and applications of HRnV and related research.",

      "abstract": "Signals from heart transplant recipients can be considered to be a natural source of information for a better understanding of the impact of the autonomic nervous system on the complexity of heart rate variability. Beat-to-beat heart rate variability can be represented as a network of increments between subsequent $RR$-intervals, which makes possible the visualization of short-term heart period fluctuations. A network is constructed of vertices representing increments between subsequent $RR$-intervals, and edges which connect adjacent $RR$-increments. Two modes of visualization of such a network are proposed. The method described is applied to nocturnal Holter signals recorded from healthy young people and from cardiac transplant recipients. Additionally, the analysis is performed on surrogate data: shuffled RR-intervals (to display short-range dependence), and shuffled phases of the Fourier Transform of RR-intervals (to filter out linear dependences). Important nonlinear properties of autonomic nocturnal regulation in short-term variability in healthy young persons are associated with $RR$-increments: accelerations and decelerations of a size greater than about 35 ms. They reveal that large accelerations are more likely antipersistent, while large decelerations are more likely persistent. Changes in $RR$-increments in a heart deprived of autonomic supervision are much lower than in a healthy individual, and appear to be maintained around a homeostatic state, but there are indications that this dynamics is nonlinear. The method is fruitful in the evaluation of the vagal activity - the quantity and quality of the vagal tone - during the nocturnal rest of healthy young people. The method also successfully extracts nonlinear effects related to intrinsic mechanisms of the heart regulation.",

      "abstract": "Currently, human drivers outperform self-driving vehicles in many conditions such as collision avoidance. Therefore, understanding human driver behaviour in these conditions will provide insight for future autonomous vehicles. For understanding driver behaviour, risk assessment is applied so far as one of the approaches by using both subjective and objective measurement. Subjective measurement methods such as questionnaires may provide insight into driver risk assessment but there is often significant variability between drivers.Physiological measurements such as heart rate (HR), electroencephalogram (EEG), and electromyogram (EMG) provide more objective measurements of driver risk assessment. HR is often used for measuring driver risk assessment based on observed correlations between HR and risk perception. Previous work has used HR to measure driver risk assessment in self-driving systems, but pedestrian dynamics is not considered for the research. In this study, we observed driver behaviour in certain scenarios which have pedestrian on driving simulator. The scenarios have safe/unsafe situations (i.e., pedestrian crosses road and vehicle may hit pedestrian in one scenario), HR analysis in time/frequency domain is processed for risk assessment. As a result, HR analysis in frequency domain shows certain reasonability for driver risk assessment when driver has pedestrian in its traffic.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases are best diagnosed using multiple modalities that assess both the heart's electrical and mechanical functions. While effective, imaging techniques like echocardiography and nuclear imaging are costly and not widely accessible. More affordable technologies, such as simultaneous electrocardiography (ECG) and phonocardiography (PCG), may provide valuable insights into electromechanical coupling and could be useful for prescreening in low-resource settings.   Using physical stress test data from the EPHNOGRAM ECG-PCG dataset, collected from 23 healthy male subjects (age: 25.4+/-1.9 yrs), we investigated electromechanical intervals (RR, QT, systolic, and diastolic) and their interactions during exercise, along with hysteresis between cardiac electrical activity and mechanical responses.   Time delay analysis revealed distinct temporal relationships between QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals, with RR as the primary driver. The diastolic interval showed near-synchrony with RR, while QT responded to RR interval changes with an average delay of 10.5s, and the systolic interval responded more slowly, with an average delay of 28.3s. We examined QT-RR, systolic-RR, and diastolic-RR hysteresis, finding narrower loops for diastolic RR and wider loops for systolic RR. Significant correlations (average:0.75) were found between heart rate changes and hysteresis loop areas, suggesting the equivalent circular area diameter as a promising biomarker for cardiac function under exercise stress.   Deep learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory and Convolutional Neural Networks, estimated the QT, systolic, and diastolic intervals from RR data, confirming the nonlinear relationship between RR and other intervals. Findings highlight a significant cardiac memory effect, linking ECG and PCG morphology and timing to heart rate history.",

      "abstract": "Understanding the dynamic relationship between RR and QT intervals is crucial for interpreting electrocardiograms (ECGs) and managing cardiac conditions. We investigated cross-correlation between RR and QT intervals in long-term ECG recordings from 202 healthy subjects using time-lagged cross-correlation analysis to explore how QT intervals correlate with both preceding and succeeding RR intervals across various time lags. Data was preprocessed with the smoothness priors method to remove long-term trends while preserving relevant short-term dynamics.   Our results reveal that, as expected, the highest RR-QT cross-correlations occur when the intervals overlap the most. Notably, we also observed a strong cross-correlation between the present QT interval and the preceding RR interval, with the overall correlations skewed toward negative lags. This suggests that past RR intervals exert a stronger influence on current QT intervals. These findings align with previous research on RR-QT transfer entropy.   We found no significant differences in RR-QT cross-correlations between sexes. However, aging was associated with significantly reduced cross-correlations across all lags. This effect is consistent with existing literature on age-related cardiac changes and provides further insight into the impact of aging on RR-QT coupling. Additionally, we observed a slight positive correlation between heart rate and cross-correlation at all lags, with cross-correlation decreasing as the lag increased. These findings enhance our understanding of the dynamic RR-QT relationship and may inform future studies on cardiac electrophysiology and diseases.",

Similar to how heart rate can provide useful information about a person's vital signs, insights about the underlying physio/psychological conditions can be obtained from heart rate variability (HRV). HRV is a measure of the fine fluctuations in the intervals between heart beats. However, this measure requires temporally locating heart beats with a high degree of precision. We introduce a refined and efficient real-time rPPG pipeline with novel filtering and motion suppression that not only estimates heart rates, but also extracts the pulse waveform to time heart beats and measure heart rate variability. This unsupervised method requires no rPPG specific training and is able to operate in real-time. We also introduce a new multi-modal video dataset, VicarPPG 2, specifically designed to evaluate rPPG algorithms on HR and HRV estimation. We validate and study our method under various conditions on a comprehensive range of public and self-recorded datasets, showing state-of-the-art results and providing useful insights into some unique aspects. Lastly, we make available CleanerPPG, a collection of human-verified ground truth peak/heart-beat annotations for existing rPPG datasets.

      "abstract": "The dynamics of the autonomic nervous system, a prime factor for variation of heart rate is modulated by lifestyle factors like meditation and breathing exercises. The effect of meditation (dhyana)practiced by disciples of Ramakrishna Mission(RKM) on the heart rate variability is examined. The heart rate (HR)of a group of disciples of RKM is obtained from ECG signal recorded over a short time duration. Lagged Poincare plot of the heart rate(HR), the method of the principal component analysis, and the autocorrelation of HR fluctuations are used to analyze the HR. The variation of Poincare parameters (SD1),(SD2) and their ratio (SD12), with a lagged number, are non-linear and reveal a significant change with meditation. In particular, the magnitude of the slope and the curvature of(SD12) with lagged number increases after meditation. The meditation reduces the heart rate and increases the stroke volume. A strong correlation between slope and curvature of (SD12) is noted from the correlation matrix of multi-dimensional data set resulting from the Poincar\\'e plot. The principal components (PC) of data resulting from pre-and post-meditation are well separated in PC-space. The entropy associated with R-wave fluctuations for all meditators is reduced after meditation. The auto-correlation of HR fluctuations exhibits a highly correlated pattern after meditation. The study suggests that meditation improves the heart rate dynamics and the 'calmness' of mind.",

On the other hand, heart rate variability is non-invasive and cheap, but not considered accurate enough for clinical practice. Here, we tackle heart beat interval based classification with deep learning. We introduce an end to end differentiable hybrid architecture, consisting of a layer of biological neuron models of cardiac dynamics (modified FitzHugh Nagumo neurons) and several layers of a standard feed-forward neural network. The proposed model is evaluated on ECGs from 474 stable at-risk (coronary artery disease) patients, and 1172 chest pain patients of an emergency department. We show that it can significantly outperform models based on traditional heart rate variability predictors, as well as approaching or in some cases outperforming clinical blood tests, based only on 60 seconds of inter-beat intervals.",

During physical exercise, the variability of the fluctuations is reduced, and the time series of beat-to-beat RR intervals (RRIs) become highly non-stationary. Here we develop a dynamical approach to analyze the time evolution of RRI correlations in running across various training and racing events under real-world conditions. In particular, we introduce dynamical detrended fluctuation analysis and dynamical partial autocorrelation functions, which are able to detect real-time changes in the scaling and correlations of the RRIs as functions of the scale and the lag. We relate these changes to the exercise intensity quantified by the heart rate (HR). Beyond subject-specific HR thresholds the RRIs show multiscale anticorrelations with both universal and individual scale-dependent structure that is potentially affected by the stride frequency. These preliminary results are encouraging for future applications of the dynamical statistical analysis in exercise physiology and cardiology, and the presented methodology is also applicable across various disciplines.",

      "abstract": "One of the most promising non-invasive markers of the activity of the autonomic nervous system is Heart Rate Variability (HRV). HRV analysis toolkits often provide spectral analysis techniques using the Fourier transform, which assumes that the heart rate series is stationary. To overcome this issue, the Short Time Fourier Transform is often used (STFT). However, the wavelet transform is thought to be a more suitable tool for analyzing non-stationary signals than the STFT. Given the lack of support for wavelet-based analysis in HRV toolkits, such analysis must be implemented by the researcher. This has made this technique underutilized. This paper presents a new algorithm to perform HRV power spectrum analysis based on the Maximal Overlap Discrete Wavelet Packet Transform (MODWPT). The algorithm calculates the power in any spectral band with a given tolerance for the band's boundaries. The MODWPT decomposition tree is pruned to avoid calculating unnecessary wavelet coefficients, thereby optimizing execution time. The center of energy shift correction is applied to achieve optimum alignment of the wavelet coefficients. This algorithm has been implemented in RHRV, an open-source package for HRV analysis. To the best of our knowledge, RHRV is the first HRV toolkit with support for wavelet-based spectral analysis.",

      "abstract": "This study addresses the classification of heartbeats from ECG signals through two distinct approaches: traditional machine learning utilizing hand-crafted features and deep learning via transformed images of ECG beats. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, including downsampling, filtering, and normalization, to ensure consistency and relevance for subsequent analysis. In the first approach, features such as heart rate variability (HRV), mean, variance, and RR intervals were extracted to train various classifiers, including SVM, Random Forest, AdaBoost, LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and LightGBM. The second approach involved transforming ECG signals into images using Gramian Angular Field (GAF), Markov Transition Field (MTF), and Recurrence Plots (RP), with these images subsequently classified using CNN architectures like VGG and Inception.   Experimental results demonstrate that the LightGBM model achieved the highest performance, with an accuracy of 99% and an F1 score of 0.94, outperforming the image-based CNN approach (F1 score of 0.85). Models such as SVM and AdaBoost yielded significantly lower scores, indicating limited suitability for this task. The findings underscore the superior ability of hand-crafted features to capture temporal and morphological variations in ECG signals compared to image-based representations of individual beats. Future investigations may benefit from incorporating multi-lead ECG signals and temporal dependencies across successive beats to enhance classification accuracy further.",

Pulse rate variability (PRV) is a common surrogate of HRV given the wide usability of PPG in commercially available devices. However, there is no clear conclusion on whether PRV can replace HRV given their different physiological mechanisms. This study evaluates the interchangeability of young adults HRV and PRV during supine-to-stand (STS) tests which are known as common posture transitions in daily life monitoring. Fifteen features from time, frequency and nonlinear domains were extracted from both electrocardiography and PPG signals. Paired t-tests and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests examined the difference between the extracted HRV and PRV features during supine, transition and standing phases separately. One feature showed significant difference in the supine phase, and this discrepancy increased to four in the transition and standing phases. These findings suggested that PRV is different from HRV in the STS tests, despite the fact that both metrics can reflect the sympathetic activation triggered by the posture changes.",

      "abstract": "Recent research is revealing how cognitive processes are supported by a complex interplay between the brain and the rest of the body, which can be investigated by the analysis of physiological features such as breathing rhythms, heart rate, and skin conductance. Heart rate dynamics are of particular interest as they provide a way to track the sympathetic and parasympathetic outflow from the autonomic nervous system, which is known to play a key role in modulating attention, memory, decision-making, and emotional processing. However, extracting useful information from heartbeats about the autonomic outflow is still challenging due to the noisy estimates that result from standard signal-processing methods. To advance this state of affairs, we propose a paradigm shift in how we conceptualise and model heart rate: instead of being a mere summary of the observed inter-beat intervals, we introduce a modelling framework that views heart rate as a hidden stochastic process that drives the observed heartbeats. Moreover, by leveraging the rich literature of state-space modelling and Bayesian inference, our proposed framework delivers a description of heart rate dynamics that is not a point estimate but a posterior distribution of a generative model. We illustrate the capabilities of our method by showing that it recapitulates linear properties of conventional heart rate estimators, while exhibiting a better discriminative power for metrics of dynamical complexity compared across different physiological states.",

In this paper, we propose several multi-modal approaches that combine 30-second ECG recordings and approximate long-term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data to estimate the risk of HF hospitalization. We introduce two survival models: an XGBoost model with Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) incorporating comprehensive ECG features and a ResNet model that learns from the raw ECG. We extend these with our novel long-term HRVs extracted from the combination of ultra-short-term beat-to-beat measurements taken over the day. To capture their temporal dynamics, we propose a survival model comprising ResNet and Transformer architectures (TFM-ResNet). Our experiments demonstrate high model performance for HF risk assessment with a concordance index of 0.8537 compared to 14 survival models and competitive discrimination power on various external ECG datasets. After transferability tests with Apple Watch data, our approach implemented in the myHeartScore App offers cost-effective and highly accessible HF risk assessment, contributing to its prevention and management.",

Ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation are the most commonly-occurring and dangerous arrhythmias, therefore early detection is crucial to prevent any further complications and reduce fatalities. Implantable devices such as pacemakers are commonly used in patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death. While great advances have been made in medical technology, there remain significant challenges in effective management of common arrhythmias. This thesis proposes novel arrhythmia detection and prediction methods to differentiate cardiac arrhythmias from non-life-threatening cardiac events, to increase the likelihood of detecting events that may lead to mortality, as well as reduce the incidence of unnecessary therapeutic intervention. The methods are based on detailed analysis of Heart Rate Variability (HRV) information.

To help address this issue, we present Heart2Mind, a human-centered contestable psychiatric disorder diagnosis system using wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors. Our approach leverages cardiac biomarkers, particularly heart rate variability (HRV) and R-R intervals (RRI) time series, as objective indicators of autonomic dysfunction in psychiatric conditions. The system comprises three key components: (1) a Cardiac Monitoring Interface (CMI) for real-time data acquisition from Polar H9/H10 devices; (2) a Multi-Scale Temporal-Frequency Transformer (MSTFT) that processes RRI time series through integrated time-frequency domain analysis; (3) a Contestable Diagnosis Interface (CDI) combining Self-Adversarial Explanations (SAEs) with contestable Large Language Models (LLMs). Our MSTFT achieves 91.7% accuracy on the HRV-ACC dataset using leave-one-out cross-validation, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. SAEs successfully detect inconsistencies in model predictions by comparing attention-based and gradient-based explanations, while LLMs enable clinicians to validate correct predictions and contest erroneous ones. This work demonstrates the feasibility of combining wearable technology with Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and contestable LLMs to create a transparent, contestable system for psychiatric diagnosis that maintains clinical oversight while leveraging advanced AI capabilities.

While multi-lead ECG recordings are often necessary for a proper assessment of cardiac rhythms, they are not always available or practical, for example in fetal ECG applications. Moreover, a wide range of small non-obtrusive single-lead ECG ambulatory monitoring devices are now available, from which heart rate variability (HRV) and other health-related metrics are derived. Proper beat detection and classification of abnormal rhythms is important for reliable HRV assessment and can be challenging in single-lead ECG monitoring devices. In this manuscript, we modeled the heart rate signal as an adaptive non-harmonic model and used the newly developed synchrosqueezing transform (SST) to characterize ECG patterns. We show how the proposed model can be used to enhance heart beat detection and classification between normal and abnormal rhythms. In particular, using the Massachusetts Institute of Technology-Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH) arrhythmia database and the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) beat classes, we trained and validated a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a portion of the annotated beat database using the SST-derived instantaneous phase, the R-peak amplitudes and R-peak to R-peak interval durations, based on a single ECG lead. We obtained sensitivities and positive predictive values comparable to other published algorithms using multiple leads and many more features.",

      "abstract": "The maturation of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) starts in the gestation period and it is completed after birth in a variable time, reaching its peak in adulthood. However, the development of ANS maturation is not entirely understood in newborns. Clinically, the ANS condition is evaluated with monitoring of gestational age, Apgar score, heart rate, and by quantification of heart rate variability using linear methods. Few researchers have addressed this problem from the perspective nonlinear data analysis. This paper proposes a new data-driven methodology using nonlinear time series analysis, based on complex networks, to classify ANS conditions in newborns. We map $74$ time series given by RR intervals from premature and full-term newborns to ordinal partition networks and use complexity quantifiers to discriminate the dynamical process present in both conditions. We obtain three complexity quantifiers (permutation, conditional and global node entropies) using network mappings from forward and reverse directions, and considering different time lags and embedding dimensions. The results indicate that time asymmetry is present in the data of both groups and the complexity quantifiers can differentiate the groups analysed. We show that the conditional and global node entropies are sensitive for detecting subtle differences between the neonates, particularly for small embedding dimensions ($m < 7$). This study reinforces the assessment of nonlinear techniques for RR intervals time series analysis.",

      "abstract": "RR Lyr is one of the most studied variable stars. Its light curve has been regularly monitored since the discovery of the periodic variability in 1899. Analysis of all observed maxima allows us to identify two primary pulsation states defined as pulsation over a long (P0 longer than 0.56684 d) and a short (P0 shorter than 0.56682 d) primary pulsation period. These states alternate with intervals of 13-16 yr, and are well defined after 1943. The 40.8 d periodical modulations of the amplitude and the period (i.e. Blazhko effect) were noticed in 1916. We provide homogeneous determinations of the Blazhko period in the different primary pulsation states. The Blazhko period does not follow the variations of P0 and suddenly diminished from 40.8 d to around 39.0 d in 1975. The monitoring of these periodicities deserved and deserves a continuous and intensive observational effort. For this purpose we have built dedicated, transportable and autonomous small instruments, Very Tiny Telescopes (VTTs), to observe the times of maximum brightness of RR Lyr. As immediate results the VTTs recorded the last change of P0 state in mid-2009 and extended the time coverage of the Kepler observations, thus recording a maximum O-C amplitude of the Blazhko effect at the end of 2008, followed by the historically smallest O-C amplitude in late 2013. This decrease is still ongoing and VTT instruments are ready to monitor the expected increase in the next few years.",

Usually HRV is measured exclusively in normal sinus rhythm (NSR) excluding any form of paroxysmal rhythm. Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most widespread cardiac arrhythmia in human population. Usually such abnormal rhythm is not analyzed and assumed to be chaotic and unpredictable. Nonetheless, ranges of HRV indices differ between patients with AF, yet physiological characteristics which influence them are poorly understood. In this study, we propose a statistical model that describes relationship between HRV indices in NSR and AF. The model is based on Mahalanobis distance, the k-Nearest neighbour approach and multivariate normal distribution framework. Verification of the method was performed using 10 min intervals of NSR and AF that were extracted from long-term Holter ECGs. For validation we used Bhattacharyya distance and Kolmogorov-Smirnov 2-sample test in a k-fold procedure. The model is able to predict at least 7 HRV indices with high precision.",

      "abstract": "Heart rate variability (HRV), defined as the variability between consecutive heartbeats, is a surrogate measure of cardiac vagal tone. It is widely accepted that a decreased HRV is associated to several risk factors and cardiovascular diseases. However, a possible association between HRV and altered cerebral hemodynamics is still debated, suffering from HRV short-term measures and the paucity of high-resolution deep cerebral data. We propose a computational approach to evaluate the deep cerebral and central hemodynamics subject to physiological alterations of HRV in an ideal young healthy patient at rest. The cardiovascular-cerebral model was validated and recently exploited to understand the hemodynamic mechanisms between cardiac arrythmia and cognitive deficit. Three configurations (baseline, increased HRV, and decreased HRV) are built based on the standard deviation (SDNN) of RR beats. In the cerebral circulation, our results show that HRV has overall a stronger impact on pressure than flow rate mean values but similarly alters pressure and flow rate in terms of extreme events. By comparing reduced and increased HRV, this latter induces a higher probability of altered mean and extreme values, and is therefore more detrimental at distal cerebral level. On the contrary, at central level a decreased HRV induces a higher cardiac effort without improving the mechano-contractile performance, thus overall reducing the heart efficiency. Present results suggest that: (i) the increase of HRV per se does not seem to be sufficient to trigger a better cerebral hemodynamic response; (ii) by accounting for both central and cerebral circulations, the optimal HRV configuration is found at baseline. Given the relation inversely linking HRV and HR, the presence of this optimal condition can contribute to explain why the mean HR of the general population settles around the baseline value (70 bpm).",

This can unfortunately affect the signal and make the analysis on detrended data less appropriate. $\\bullet$ Objective : Investigate the detrending effect (linear \\& nonlinear) in temporal / nonliear analysis of heart rate variability of long-term RR data (in normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation, 15 congestive heart failure and ventricular premature arrhythmia conditions). $\\bullet$ Methods : Temporal method : standard measure SDNN; Nonlinear methods : multi-scale Fractal Dimension (FD), Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) \\& Sample Entropy (Sam-pEn) analysis. $\\bullet$ Results : The linear detrending affects little the global characteristics of the RR data, either 20 in temporal analysis or in nonlinear complexity analysis. After linear detrending, the SDNNs are just slightly shifted and all distributions are well preserved. The cross-scale complexity remained almost the same as the ones for original RR data or correlated. Nonlinear detrending changed not only the SDNNs distribution, but also the order among different types of RR data. After this processing, the SDNN became indistinguishable be-25 tween SDNN for normal sinus rhythm and ventricular premature beats. Different RR data has different complexity signature. Nonlinear detrending made the all RR data to be similar , in terms of complexity. It is thus impossible to distinguish them. The FD showed that nonlinearly detrended RR data has a dimension close to 2, the exponent from DFA is close to zero and SampEn is larger than 1.5 -- these complexity values are very close to those for 30 random signal. $\\bullet$ Conclusions : Pre-processing by linear detrending can be performed on RR data, which has little influence on the corresponding analysis. Nonlinear detrending could be harmful and it is not advisable to use this type of pre-processing. Exceptions do exist, but only combined with other appropriate techniques to avoid complete change of the signal's intrinsic dynamics. 35 Keywords $\\bullet$ heart rate variability $\\bullet$ linear / nonlinear detrending $\\bullet$ complexity analysis $\\bullet$ mul-tiscale analysis $\\bullet$ detrended fluctuation analysis $\\bullet$ fractal dimension $\\bullet$ sample entropy;",

      "abstract": "Biosignal monitoring, in particular heart activity through heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) tracking, is vital in enabling continuous, non-invasive tracking of physiological and cognitive states. Recent studies have explored compact, head-worn devices for HR and HRV monitoring to improve usability and reduce stigma. However, this approach is challenged by the current reliance on wet electrodes, which limits usability, the weakness of ear-derived signals, making HR/HRV extraction more complex, and the incompatibility of current algorithms for embedded deployment. This work introduces a single-ear wearable system for real-time ECG (Electrocardiogram) parameter estimation, which directly runs on BioGAP, an energy-efficient device for biosignal acquisition and processing. By combining SoA in-ear electrode technology, an optimized DeepMF algorithm, and BioGAP, our proposed subject-independent approach allows for robust extraction of HR/HRV parameters directly on the device with just 36.7 uJ/inference at comparable performance with respect to the current state-of-the-art architecture, achieving 0.49 bpm and 25.82 ms for HR/HRV mean errors, respectively and an estimated battery life of 36h with a total system power consumption of 7.6 mW. Clinical relevance: The ability to reconstruct ECG signals and extract HR and HRV paves the way for continuous, unobtrusive cardiovascular monitoring with head-worn devices. In particular, the integration of cardiovascular measurements in everyday-use devices (such as earbuds) has potential in continuous at-home monitoring to enable early detection of cardiovascular irregularities.",

The occurrence of this dynamical effect in modulated RR Lyrae stars might help us to gain more information about the mysterious Blazhko effect. The temporal variability of the additional frequencies in representatives of all subtypes of RR Lyrae stars is also investigated. We pre-process CoRoT light curves by applying trend and jump correction and outlier removal. Standard Fourier technique is used to analyze the frequency content of our targets and follow the time dependent phenomena. The most comprehensive collection of CoRoT RR Lyrae stars, including new discoveries is presented and analyzed. We found alternating maxima and in some cases half-integer frequencies in four CoRoT Blazhko RR Lyrae stars, as clear signs of the presence of period doubling. This reinforces that period doubling is an important ingredient to understand the Blazhko effect - a premise we derived previously from the Kepler RR Lyrae sample. As expected, period doubling is detectable only for short time intervals in most modulated RRab stars. Our results show that the temporal variability of the additional frequencies in all RR Lyrae sub-types is ubiquitous. The ephemeral nature and the highly variable amplitude of these variations suggest a complex underlying dynamics of and an intricate interplay between radial and possibly nonradial modes in RR Lyrae stars. The omnipresence of additional modes in all types of RR Lyrae - except in non-modulated RRab stars - implies that asteroseismology of these objects should be feasible in the near future (Abridged).",
