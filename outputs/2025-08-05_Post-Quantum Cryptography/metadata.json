In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and systematic survey of threshold and distributed signatures with advanced features. Our survey encompasses threshold signatures in conventional and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) settings and captures custom-design and standard signatures (e.g., conventional NIST and NIST-PQC).

      "abstract": "In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed (IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future deployment of PQC systems.",

The upcoming standards are intended to replace (or supplement) current RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) on all targets, including lightweight, embedded, and mobile systems. We present an energy requirement analysis based on extensive measurements of PQC candidate algorithms on a Cortex M4 - based reference platform. We relate computational (energy) costs of PQC algorithms to their data transmission costs which are expected to increase with new types of public keys and ciphertext messages. The energy, bandwidth, and latency needs of PQC algorithms span several orders of magnitude, which is substantial enough to impact battery life, user experience, and application protocol design. We propose metrics and guidelines for PQC algorithm usage in IoT and mobile systems based on our findings. Our evidence supports the view that fast structured-lattice PQC schemes are the preferred choice for cloud-connected mobile devices in most use cases, even when per-bit data transmission energy cost is relatively high.",

Hence, a community effort exists to develop post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, i.e., algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks. In this work, we have investigated how lattice-based candidate algorithms from the NIST PQC standardization competition fare when conceived as hardware accelerators. To achieve this, we have assessed the reference implementations of selected algorithms with the goal of identifying what are their basic building blocks. We assume the hardware accelerators will be implemented in application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and the targeted technology in our experiments is a commercial 65nm node. In order to estimate the characteristics of each algorithm, we have assessed their memory requirements, use of multipliers, and how each algorithm employs hashing functions. Furthermore, for these building blocks, we have collected area and power figures for 12 candidate algorithms. For memories, we make use of a commercial memory compiler. For logic, we make use of a standard cell library. In order to compare the candidate algorithms fairly, we select a reference frequency of operation of 500MHz. Our results reveal that our area and power numbers are comparable to the state of the art, despite targeting a higher frequency of operation and a higher security level in our experiments. The comprehensive investigation of lattice-based NIST PQC algorithms performed in this paper can be used for guiding ASIC designers when selecting an appropriate algorithm while respecting requirements and design constraints.",

      "abstract": "Due to the current standard of Security Credential Management System (SCMS) for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications using asymmetric cryptography, specifically Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), which may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Therefore, the V2X SCMS is threatened by quantum computing attacks. However, although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already selected Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms as the standard, the current PQC algorithms may have issues such as longer public key lengths, longer signature lengths, or lower signature generation and verification efficiency, which may not fully meet the requirements of V2X communication applications. In view of the challenges in V2X communication, such as packet length, signature generation and verification efficiency, security level, and vehicle privacy, this study proposes a hybrid certificate scheme of PQC and ECC. By leveraging the strengths of both PQC and ECC, this scheme aims to overcome the challenges in V2X communication. PQC is used to establish a security level resistant to quantum computing attacks, while ECC is utilized to establish anonymous certificates and reduce packet length to meet the requirements of V2X communication. In the practical experiments, the study implemented the SCMS end entity based on the Chunghwa Telecom SCMS and the Clientron On-Board Unit (OBU) to conduct field tests in Danhai New Town in New Taipei City. The performance of various existing hybrid certificate schemes combining PQC (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+) and ECC is compared, and a practical solution is provided for V2X industries.",

      "abstract": "With the constantly advancing capabilities of quantum computers, conventional cryptographic systems relying on complex math problems may encounter unforeseen vulnerabilities. Unlike regular computers, which are often deemed cost-ineffective in cryptographic attacks, quantum computers have a significant advantage in calculation speed. This distinction potentially makes currently used algorithms less secure or even completely vulnerable, compelling the exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as the most reasonable solution to quantum threats. This review aims to provide current information on applications, benefits, and challenges associated with the PQC. The review employs a systematic scoping review with the scope restricted to the years 2022 and 2023; only articles that were published in scientific journals were used in this paper. The review examined the articles on the applications of quantum computing in various spheres. However, the scope of this paper was restricted to the domain of the PQC because most of the analyzed articles featured this field. Subsequently, the paper is analyzing various PQC algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial, and isogeny-based cryptography. Each algorithm is being judged based on its potential applications, robustness, and challenges. All the analyzed algorithms are promising for the post-quantum era in such applications as digital signatures, communication channels, and IoT. Moreover, some of the algorithms are already implemented in the spheres of banking transactions, communication, and intellectual property. Meanwhile, despite their potential, these algorithms face serious challenges since they lack standardization, require vast amounts of storage and computation power, and might have unknown vulnerabilities that can be discovered only with years of cryptanalysis.",

Using a full 5G emulation stack (Open5GS and UERANSIM) and PQC-enabled TLS 1.3 via BoringSSL and liboqs, we examine key encapsulation mechanisms and digital signature schemes across realistic network conditions. We evaluate performance based on handshake latency, CPU and memory usage, bandwidth, and retransmission rates, under varying cryptographic configurations and client loads.

Since, all processors have built-in Hardware Performance Counters (HPCs), there exists a body of work proposing a low-cost Machine Learning (ML)-based integrity checking of software using HPC fingerprints. However, such HPC-based approaches may not detect subversion of PQC codes. A miniscule percentage of qualitative inputs when applied to the PQC codes improve this accuracy to 98%.

An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community.   On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of \"cryptographic agility\".",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of quantum computers threatens traditional cryptographic schemes, prompting the need for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Although the NIST standardization process has accelerated the development of such algorithms, their application in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems remains a challenge. Automotive systems relying on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus for communication are particularly vulnerable due to their limited computational capabilities, high traffic, and need for real-time response. These constraints raise concerns about the feasibility of implementing PQC in automotive environments, where legacy hardware and bit rate limitations must also be considered.   In this paper, we introduce PQ-CAN, a modular framework for simulating the performance and overhead of PQC algorithms in embedded systems. We consider the automotive domain as our case study, testing a variety of PQC schemes under different scenarios. Our simulation enables the adjustment of embedded system computational capabilities and CAN bus bit rate constraints. We also provide insights into the trade-offs involved by analyzing each algorithm's security level and overhead for key encapsulation and digital signature. By evaluating the performance of these algorithms, we provide insights into their feasibility and identify the strengths and limitations of PQC in securing automotive communications in the post-quantum era.",

We present different methodologies to embed the problem into a Hamiltonian that can be solved by available quantum annealing platforms. In particular, we provide three embedding options, and we highlight their differences in terms of quantum resources.

This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform performance analysis of leading PQC Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures (NIST standards/candidates) compared against classical RSA/ECC. We evaluated execution time, communication costs (key/signature sizes), and memory footprint indicators on high-performance (macOS/M4, Ubuntu/x86) and constrained platforms (Raspberry Pi 4/ARM). Our quantitative results reveal lattice-based schemes, notably NIST standards ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium), provide a strong balance of computational efficiency and moderate communication/storage overhead, making them highly suitable for many CE applications. In contrast, code-based Classic McEliece imposes significant key size challenges, while hash-based SPHINCS+ offers high security assurance but demands large signature sizes impacting bandwidth and storage.

However, we need to continue developing post-quantum cryptosystems based on other quantum hard problems to prevent a complete collapse of post-quantum cryptography due to a sudden breakthrough in solving hard lattice problems. Solving large multivariate quadratic systems is one such quantum hard problem.   Unbalanced Oil-Vinegar is a signature scheme based on the hardness of solving multivariate equations. In this work, we present a post-quantum digital signature algorithm VDOO (Vinegar-Diagonal-Oil-Oil) based on solving multivariate equations. We introduce a new layer called the diagonal layer over the oil-vinegar-based signature scheme Rainbow. This layer helps to improve the security of our scheme without increasing the parameters considerably. Due to this modification, the complexity of the main computational bottleneck of multivariate quadratic systems i.e. the Gaussian elimination reduces significantly. Thus making our scheme one of the fastest multivariate quadratic signature schemes. Further, we show that our carefully chosen parameters can resist all existing state-of-the-art attacks. The signature sizes of our scheme for the National Institute of Standards and Technology's security level of I, III, and V are 96, 226, and 316 bytes, respectively. This is the smallest signature size among all known post-quantum signature schemes of similar security.",

While this paradigm enhances communication efficiency by only requiring updates at the end of each training epoch, the transmitted model updates remain vulnerable to malicious tampering, posing risks to the integrity of the global model. Although current digital signature algorithms can protect these communicated model updates, they fail to ensure quantum security in the era of large-scale quantum computing. Fortunately, various post-quantum cryptography algorithms have been developed to address this vulnerability, especially the three NIST-standardized algorithms - Dilithium, FALCON, and SPHINCS+. In this work, we empirically investigate the impact of these three NIST-standardized PQC algorithms for digital signatures within the FL procedure, covering a wide range of models, tasks, and FL settings. Our results indicate that Dilithium stands out as the most efficient PQC algorithm for digital signature in federated learning.

While many currently used public-key cryptosystems would be broken by Shor's algorithm, the effect of quantum computing on symmetric ones is still unclear. The security of symmetric ciphers relies heavily on the development of cryptanalytic tools. Thus, in order to accurately evaluate the security of symmetric primitives in the post-quantum world, it is significant to improve classical cryptanalytic methods using quantum algorithms. In this paper, we focus on two variants of differential cryptanalysis: truncated differential cryptanalysis and impossible differential cryptanalysis. Based on the fact that Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can be used to find the linear structures of Boolean functions, we propose two quantum algorithms that can be used to find high-probability truncated differentials and impossible differentials of block ciphers, respectively. We rigorously prove the validity of the algorithms and analyze their complexity. Our algorithms treat all rounds of the reduced cipher as a whole and only concerns the input and output differences at its both ends, instead of specific differential characteristics. Therefore, to a certain extent, they alleviate the weakness of conventional differential cryptanalysis, namely the difficulties in finding differential characteristics as the number of rounds increases.",

NIST has also issued a new call for quantum-safe digital signature algorithms due June 1, 2023. This timeline shows that FIPS-certified quantum-safe TLS protocol would take a predictably long time. However, \"steal now, crack later\" tactic requires protecting data against future quantum threat actors today. NIST recommended the use of a hybrid mode of TLS 1.3 with its extensions to support PQC. The hybrid mode works for certain cases but FIPS certification for the hybridized cryptomodule might still be required. This paper proposes to take a nested mode to enable TLS 1.3 protocol with quantum-safe data, which can be made available today and is FIPS compliant. We discussed the performance impacts of the handshaking phase of the nested TLS 1.3 with PQC and the symmetric encryption phase. The major impact on performance using the nested mode is in the data symmetric encryption with AES. To overcome this performance reduction, we suggest using quantum encryption with a quantum permutation pad for the data encryption with a minor performance reduction of less than 10 percent.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing becomes more of a reality as time passes, bringing several cybersecurity challenges. Modern cryptography is based on the computational complexity of specific mathematical problems, but as new quantum-based computers appear, classical methods might not be enough to secure communications. In this paper, we analyse the state of the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) to overcome these new threats. This analysis and its assessment have been performed using OSNMA documentation, reviewing the available Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms competing in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process, and studying the possibility of its implementation in the Galileo service. The main barrier to adopting the PQC approach is the size of both the signature and the key. The analysis shows that OSNMA is not yet prepared to face the quantum threat, and a significant change would be required. This work concludes by assessing different temporal countermeasures that can be implemented to sustain the system's integrity in the short term.",

The rapid advances in quantum computing have brought immense opportunities for scientific discovery and technological progress; however, it poses a major risk to today's security since advanced quantum computers are believed to break all traditional public-key cryptographic algorithms. This has led to active research on PQC algorithms that are believed to be secure against classical and powerful quantum computers. However, algorithmic security is unfortunately insufficient, and many cryptographic algorithms are vulnerable to side-channel attacks (SCA), where an attacker passively or actively gets side-channel data to compromise the security properties that are assumed to be safe theoretically. In this survey, we explore such imminent threats and their countermeasures with respect to PQC. We provide the respective, latest advancements in PQC research, as well as assessments and providing visions on the different types of SCAs.",

In the ensuing 39 years QKD systems have been deployed around the world to provide secure encryption for terrestrial as well as satellite communication. In 2016 the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) began a program to standardize a series of quantum resistant algorithms to replace our current encryption standards thereby protecting against future quantum computers breaking public key cryptography. This program is known as post quantum cryptography or PQC. One of the tenets of cybersecurity is to use an approach that simultaneously provides multiple protections known as defense-in-depth. This approach seeks to avoid single points of failure. The goal of this paper is to examine the suitability of a hybrid QKD / PQC defense-in-depth strategy. A focus of the paper will be to examine the sufficiency of initial QKD hardware authentication (entity source authentication) which is necessary to guard against man-in-the-middle attacks.",

Shor's algorithm poses a significant threat to RSA and ECC, while Grover's algorithm reduces the security of symmetric encryption schemes, such as AES. The objective of this paper is to underscore the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to mitigate these risks in TCPS by analyzing the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic schemes and the applicability of standardized PQC schemes in TCPS. We analyzed vulnerabilities in traditional cryptography against quantum attacks and reviewed the applicability of NIST-standardized PQC schemes, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and SPHINCS+, in TCPS. We conducted a case study to analyze the vulnerabilities of a TCPS application from the Architecture Reference for Cooperative and Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT) service package, i.e., Electronic Toll Collection, leveraging the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool. This case study highlights the cryptographic vulnerabilities of a TCPS application and presents how PQC can effectively counter these threats. Additionally, we evaluated CRYSTALS-Kyber's performance across wired and wireless TCPS data communication scenarios. While CRYSTALS-Kyber proves effective in securing TCPS applications over high-bandwidth, low-latency Ethernet networks, our analysis highlights challenges in meeting the stringent latency requirements of safety-critical wireless applications within TCPS. Future research should focus on developing lightweight PQC solutions and hybrid schemes that integrate traditional and PQC algorithms, to enhance compatibility, scalability, and real-time performance, ensuring robust protection against emerging quantum threats in TCPS.",

Quantum computing severely threatens modern cryptography, as the hard mathematical problems beneath classic public-key cryptosystems can be solved easily by a sufficiently large quantum computer. As such, researchers have proposed PQC based on problems that even quantum computers cannot efficiently solve. Generally, post-quantum encryption and signatures can be hard to compute. This could potentially be a problem for IoT, which usually consist lightweight devices with limited computational power. In this paper, we survey existing literature on the performance for PQC in resource-constrained devices to understand the severeness of this problem. We also review recent proposals to optimize PQC algorithms for resource-constrained devices. Overall, we find that whilst PQC may be feasible for reasonably lightweight IoT, proposals for their optimization seem to lack standardization. As such, we suggest future research to seek coordination, in order to ensure an efficient and safe migration toward IoT for the post-quantum era.",

Our implementation maintains compatibility with existing DNS resolution flows while providing on-the-fly signing using quantum-resistant signatures. A benchmark has been performed and performance evaluation results reveal significant trade-offs between security and efficiency. The results indicate that while PQC algorithms introduce operational overhead, several candidates offer viable compromises for transitioning DNSSEC to quantum-resistant cryptography.",

Quantum computers, along with quantum algorithms, make the standard cryptography based on RSA or ECDSA over FL or Blockchain vulnerable.

In this work, we propose a hybrid approach to employ PQC over blockchain-based FL (BFL), where we combine a stateless signature scheme like Dilithium (or Falcon) with a stateful hash-based signature scheme like the extended Merkle Signature Scheme (XMSS). We propose a linear-based formulaic approach to device role selection mechanisms based on multiple factors to address the performance aspect. Our holistic approach of utilizing a verifiable random function (VRF) to assist in the blockchain consensus mechanism shows the practicality of the proposed approaches. The proposed method and extensive experimental results contribute to enhancing the security and performance aspects of BFL systems.",

This system, whose security relies on the hardness of the well-known MinRank problem, is shown to be resilient to several straightforward algebraic attacks.

In this thesis, we look at Unclonability in a broader context in physics and computer science and more specifically through the lens of cryptography, learnability and hardware assumptions. We introduce new notions of unclonability in the quantum world, namely quantum physical unclonability, and study the relationship with cryptographic properties and assumptions such as unforgeability, and quantum pseudorandomness. The purpose of this study is to bring new insights into the field of quantum cryptanalysis and into the notion of unclonability itself. We also discuss several applications of this new type of unclonability as a cryptographic resource for designing provably secure quantum protocols. Furthermore, we present a new practical cryptanalysis technique concerning the problem of approximate cloning of quantum states. We design a quantum machine learning-based cryptanalysis algorithm to demonstrate the power of quantum learning tools as both attack strategies and powerful tools for the practical study of quantum unclonability.",

In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology released the final version of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithm standards in August 2024.

Therefore, this study proposes the Post-Quantum Cryptography Winternitz-Chen (PQCWC) anonymous scheme, aimed at exploring the design of anonymous schemes based on PQC for future applications in privacy protection. The anonymous scheme designed in this study is mainly built on the Winternitz signature scheme, which can prevent the original public key from being exposed in the certificate. Furthermore, the PQCWC anonymous scheme integrates the butterfly key expansion mechanism, proposing the first hash-based butterfly key expansion mechanism in the world, achieving anonymity for both the registration authority and the certificate authority, thereby fully protecting privacy. In the experimental environment, this study compares various hash algorithms, including Secure Hash Algorithm-1 (SHA-1), the SHA-2 series, the SHA-3 series, and the BLAKE series. The results demonstrate that the proposed anonymous scheme can achieve anonymity without increasing key length, signature length, key generation time, signature generation time, or signature verification time.",
