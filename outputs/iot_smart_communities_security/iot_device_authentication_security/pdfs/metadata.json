      "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) drastically increases the number of connected devices in homes, workplaces and smart city infrastructures. This drives a need for means to not only ensure confidentiality of device-related communications, but for device configuration and management---ensuring that only legitimate devices are granted privileges to a local domain, that only authorized agents have access to the device and data it holds, and that software updates are authentic. The need to support device on-boarding, ongoing device management and control, and secure decommissioning dictates a suite of key management services for both access control to devices, and access by devices to wireless infrastructure and networked resources. We identify this core functionality, and argue for the recognition of efficient and reliable key management support---both within IoT devices, and by a unifying external management platform---as a baseline requirement for an IoT world. We present a framework architecture to facilitate secure, flexible and convenient device management in commodity IoT scenarios, and offer an illustrative set of protocols as a base solution---not to promote specific solution details, but to highlight baseline functionality to help domain owners oversee deployments of large numbers of independent multi-vendor IoT devices.",

      "abstract": "To meet the diverse needs of users, the rapid advancement of cloud-edge-device collaboration has become a standard practice. However, this complex environment, particularly in untrusted (non-collaborative) scenarios, presents numerous security challenges. Authentication acts as the first line of defense and is fundamental to addressing these issues. Although many authentication and key agreement schemes exist, they often face limitations, such as being tailored to overly specific scenarios where devices authenticate solely with either the edge or the cloud, or being unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive and efficient authentication and key agreement scheme (AEAKA) for Cloud-Edge-Device IoT environments. This scheme is highly adaptive and scalable, capable of automatically and dynamically initiating different authentication methods based on device requirements. Additionally, it employs an edge-assisted authentication approach to reduce the load on third-party trust authorities. Furthermore, we introduce a hash-based algorithm for the authentication protocol, ensuring a lightweight method suitable for a wide range of resource-constrained devices while maintaining security. AEAKA ensures that entities use associated authentication credentials, enhancing the privacy of the authentication process. Security proofs and performance analyses demonstrate that AEAKA outperforms other methods in terms of security and authentication efficiency.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has improved people's lives by seamlessly integrating into many facets of modern life and facilitating information sharing across platforms. Device Authentication and Key exchange are major challenges for the IoT. High computational resource requirements for cryptographic primitives and message transmission during Authentication make the existing methods like PKI and IBE not suitable for these resource constrained devices. PUF appears to offer a practical and economical security mechanism in place of typically sophisticated cryptosystems like PKI and IBE. PUF provides an unclonable and tamper sensitive unique signature based on the PUF chip by using manufacturing process variability. Therefore, in this study, we use lightweight bitwise XOR, hash function, and PUF to Authenticate IoT devices. Despite several studies employing the PUF to authenticate communication between IoT devices, to the authors' knowledge, existing solutions require intermediary gateway and internet capabilities by the IoT device to directly interact with a Server for Authentication and hence, are not scalable when the IoT device works on different technologies like BLE, Zigbee, etc. To address the aforementioned issue, we present a system in which the IoT device does not require a continuous active internet connection to communicate with the server in order to Authenticate itself. The results of a thorough security study are validated against adversarial attacks and PUF modeling attacks. For formal security validation, the AVISPA verification tool is also used. Performance study recommends this protocol's lightweight characteristics. The proposed protocol's acceptability and defenses against adversarial assaults are supported by a prototype developed with ESP32.",

      "abstract": "Secure and efficient multi-user access mechanisms are increasingly important for the growing number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being used today.   Kerberos is a well-known and time-tried security authentication and access control system for distributed systems wherein many users securely access various distributed services. Traditionally, these services are software applications or devices, such as printers. However, Kerberos is not directly suitable for IoT devices due to its relatively heavy-weight protocols and the resource-constrained nature of the devices.   This paper presents KESIC, a system that enables efficient and secure multi-user access for IoT devices. KESIC aims to facilitate mutual authentication of IoT devices and users via Kerberos without modifying the latter's protocols. To facilitate that, KESIC includes a special Kerberized service, called IoT Server, that manages access to IoT devices. KESIC presents two protocols for secure and comprehensive multi-user access system for two types of IoT devices: general and severely power constrained. In terms of performance, KESIC onsumes $\\approx~47$ times less memory, and incurs $\\approx~135$ times lower run-time overhead than Kerberos.",

      "abstract": "As IoT becomes omnipresent vast amounts of data are generated, which can be used for building innovative applications. However,interoperability issues and security concerns, prevent harvesting the full potentials of these data. In this paper we consider the use case of data generated by smart buildings. Buildings are becoming ever \"smarter\" by integrating IoT devices that improve comfort through sensing and automation. However, these devices and their data are usually siloed in specific applications or manufacturers, even though they can be valuable for various interested stakeholders who provide different types of \"over the top\" services, e.g., energy management. Most data sharing techniques follow an \"all or nothing\" approach, creating significant security and privacy threats, when even partially revealed, privacy-preserving, data subsets can fuel innovative applications. With these in mind we develop a platform that enables controlled, privacy-preserving sharing of data items. Our system innovates in two directions: Firstly, it provides a framework for allowing discovery and selective disclosure of IoT data without violating their integrity. Secondly, it provides a user-friendly, intuitive mechanisms allowing efficient, fine-grained access control over the shared data. Our solution leverages recent advances in the areas of Self-Sovereign Identities, Verifiable Credentials, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs, and it integrates them in a platform that combines the industry-standard authorization framework OAuth 2.0 and the Web of Things specifications.",

As existing authentication solutions proposed for IoT environments do not provide multi-level authentication assurance, particularly for device-to-device authentication scenarios, we recently proposed the M2I (Multi-Factor Multi-Level and Interaction based Authentication) framework to facilitate multi-factor authentication of devices in device-to-device and device-to-multiDevice interactions. In this paper, we extend the framework to address group authentication. Two Many-to-One (M2O) protocols are proposed, the Hybrid Group Authentication and Key Acquisition (HGAKA) protocol and the Hybrid Group Access (HGA) protocol. The protocols use a combination of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic primitives to facilitate multifactor group authentication. The informal analysis and formal security verification show that the protocols satisfy the desirable security requirements and are secure against authentication attacks.",

      "abstract": "Nowadays, Internet of Things (IoT) is a trending topic in the computing world. Notably, IoT devices have strict design requirements and are often referred to as constrained devices. Therefore, security techniques and primitives that are lightweight are more suitable for such devices, e.g., Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs) and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). SRAM PUF is an intrinsic security primitive that is seeing widespread adoption in the IoT segment. ECC is a public-key algorithm technique that has been gaining popularity among constrained IoT devices. The popularity is due to using significantly smaller operands when compared to other public-key techniques such as RSA (Rivest Shamir Adleman). This paper shows the design, development, and evaluation of an application-specific secure communication architecture based on SRAM PUF technology and ECC for constrained IoT devices. More specifically, it introduces an Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) public-key based cryptographic protocol that utilizes PUF-derived keys as the root-of-trust for silicon authentication. Also, it proposes a design of a modular hardware architecture that supports the protocol. Finally, to analyze the practicality as well as the feasibility of the proposed protocol, we demonstrate the solution by prototyping and verifying a protocol variant on the commercial Xilinx Zynq-7000 APSoC device.",

IIoT suffers from various challenges and security is one of the key challenge among those challenges. Authentication and access control are two notable challenges for any Industrial IoT (IIoT) based industrial deployment. Any IoT based Industry 4.0 enterprise designs networks between hundreds of tiny devices such as sensors, actuators, fog devices and gateways. Thus, articulating a secure authentication protocol between sensing devices or a sensing device and user devices is an essential step in IoT security. In this paper, first, we present cryptanalysis for the certificate-based scheme proposed for similar environment by Das et al. and prove that their scheme is vulnerable to various traditional attacks such as device anonymity, MITM, and DoS. We then put forward an inter-device authentication scheme using an ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) that is highly secure and lightweight compared to other schemes for a similar environment. Furthermore, we set forth a formal security analysis using the random oracle based ROR model and informal security analysis over the Doleve-Yao channel. In this paper, we present the comparison of the proposed scheme with existing schemes based on communication cost, computation cost and security index to prove that the proposed EBAKE-SE is highly efficient, reliable, and trustworthy compared to other existing schemes for inter-device authentication.

      "abstract": "The existing high-friction device onboarding process hinders the promise and potentiality of Internet of Things (IoT). Even after several attempts by various device manufacturers and working groups, no widely adopted standard solution came to fruition. The latest attempt by Fast Identity Online (FIDO) Alliance promises a zero touch solution for mass market IoT customers, but the burden is transferred to the intermediary supply chain (i.e. they have to maintain infrastructure for managing keys and digital signatures called `Ownership Voucher' for all devices). The specification relies on a `Rendezvous Server' mimicking the notion of Domain Name System (DNS) server'. This essentially means resurrecting all existing possible attack scenarios associated with DNS, which include Denial of Service (DoS) attack, and Correlation attack. `Ownership Voucher' poses the risk that some intermediary supply chain agents may act maliciously and reject the transfer of ownership or sign with a wrong key. Furthermore, the deliberate use of the weak elliptic curve SECP256r1/SECP384r1 (also known as NIST P-256/384) in the specification raises questions. We introduce ASOP: a sovereign and secure device onboarding protocol for IoT devices without blindly trusting the device manufacturer, supply chain, and cloud service provider. The ASOP protocol allows onboarding an IoT device to a cloud server with the help of an authenticator owned by the user. This paper outlines the preliminary development of the protocol and its high-level description. Our `zero-trust' and `human-in-the-loop' approach guarantees that the device owner does not remain at the mercy of third-party infrastructures, and it utilises recently standardized post-quantum cryptographic suite (CRYSTALS) to secure connection and messages.",

      "abstract": "The Internet-of-Things (IoT) has brought in new challenges in, device identification --what the device is, and, authentication --is the device the one it claims to be. Traditionally, the authentication problem is solved by means of a cryptographic protocol. However, the computational complexity of cryptographic protocols and/or scalability problems related to key management, render almost all cryptography based authentication protocols impractical for IoT. The problem of device identification is, on the other hand, sadly neglected. We believe that device fingerprinting can be used to solve both these problems effectively. In this work, we present a methodology to perform device behavioral fingerprinting that can be employed to undertake device type identification. A device behavior is approximated using features extracted from the network traffic of the device. These features are used to train a machine learning model that can be used to detect similar device types. We validate our approach using five-fold cross validation; we report a identification rate of 86-99% and a mean accuracy of 99%, across all our experiments. Our approach is successful even when a device uses encrypted communication. Furthermore, we show preliminary results for fingerprinting device categories, i.e., identifying different device types having similar functionality.",

      "abstract": "Medical Internet of Things (IoMT) is the next frontier in the digital revolution and is utilized in healthcare. In this context, IoT enables individuals to remotely manage their essential activities with minimal interaction. However, the limitations of network resources and the challenges of establishing a secure channel, as well as sharing and collecting sensitive information through an insecure public channel, pose security challenges for the medical IoT. This paper presents a lightweight multi-factor authentication and anonymous user authentication scheme to access real-time data in a blockchain-based environment. The scheme utilizes an insecure channel called L2AI. L2AI ensures security and efficiency while enhancing user anonymity through the use of pseudo-identity and dynamic indexing. The proposed method supports highly scalable systems with an efficient user registration process, allowing authenticated users to access both existing and newly added system entities without additional processes. Although the scheme is primarily designed for large systems, such as health infrastructure, it is also suitable for resource-constrained devices. The scheme relies on one-way cryptographic hashing functions and bitwise XOR operations. Additionally, a fuzzy mining algorithm is employed on the user side to verify the user's biometric information. L2AI adopts the \"Real-Or-Random (ROR)\" model for security proof and employs BAN logic for proof of authenticity. Formal security verification is conducted using the \"Automatic Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Programs\" (Proverif) tool, complemented by informal security analysis demonstrating the proper functionality of L2AI.",

Conventional authentication and authorization schemes are insufficient in dealing the emerging IoT security challenges due to their reliance on both static digital mechanisms and computational complexity for improving security level. Furthermore, the isolated security designs for different layers and link segments while ignoring the overall protection lead to cascaded security risks as well as growing communication latency and overhead. In this article, we envision new artificial intelligence (AI) enabled security provisioning approaches to overcome these issues while achieving fast authentication and progressive authorization. To be more specific, a lightweight intelligent authentication approach is developed by exploring machine learning at the gateway to identify the access time slots or frequencies of resource-constraint devices. Then we propose a holistic authentication and authorization approach, where online machine learning and trust management are adopted for analyzing the complex dynamic environment and achieving adaptive access control. These new AI enabled approaches establish the connections between transceivers quickly and enhance security progressively, so that communication latency can be reduced and security risks are well-controlled in large-scale IoT. Finally, we outline several areas for AI-enabled security provisioning for future researches.",

      "abstract": "Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) offers significant potential for managing identities in the Internet of Things (IoT), enabling decentralized authentication and credential management without reliance on centralized entities. However, existing SSI frameworks often limit credential issuance and revocation to trusted entities, such as IoT manufacturers, which restricts flexibility in dynamic IoT ecosystems. In this paper, we propose a blockchain-based SSI framework that allows any individual with a verifiable trust linkage to act as a credential issuer, ensuring decentralized and scalable identity management. Our framework incorporates a layered architecture, where trust is dynamically established through endorsement-based calculations and maintained via a hierarchical chain-of-trust mechanism. Blockchain serves as the Verifiable Data Registry, ensuring transparency and immutability of identity operations, while smart contracts automate critical processes such as credential issuance, verification, and revocation. A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrates that the proposed framework is feasible and incurs minimal overheads compared to the baseline, making it well-suited for dynamic and resource-constrained IoT environments.",

The current IoT ecosystem relies on several IoT management platforms to manage and operate a large number of IoT devices, their data, and their connectivity. Considering their key role, these platforms must be properly secured against cyber attacks. In this work, we first explore the core operations/features of leading platforms to design a framework to perform a systematic security evaluation of these platforms. Subsequently, we use our framework to analyze a representative set of 52 IoT management platforms, including 42 web-hosted and 10 locally-deployable platforms. We discover a number of high severity unauthorized access vulnerabilities in 9/52 evaluated IoT management platforms, which could be abused to perform attacks such as remote IoT SIM deactivation, IoT SIM overcharging and IoT device data forgery. More seriously, we also uncover instances of broken authentication in 13/52 platforms, including complete account takeover on 8/52 platforms along with remote code execution on 2/52 platforms. In effect, 17/52 platforms were affected by vulnerabilities that could lead to platform-wide attacks. Overall, vulnerabilities were uncovered in 33 platforms, out of which 28 platforms responded to our responsible disclosure. We were also assigned 11 CVEs and awarded bounty for our findings.",

      "abstract": "The proliferation of consumer IoT products in our daily lives has raised the need for secure device authentication and access control. Unfortunately, these resource-constrained devices typically use token-based authentication, which is vulnerable to token compromise attacks that allow attackers to impersonate the devices and perform malicious operations by stealing the access token. Using hardware fingerprints to secure their authentication is a promising way to mitigate these threats. However, once attackers have stolen some hardware fingerprints (e.g., via MitM attacks), they can bypass the hardware authentication by training a machine learning model to mimic fingerprints or reusing these fingerprints to craft forge requests.   In this paper, we present MCU-Token, a secure hardware fingerprinting framework for MCU-based IoT devices even if the cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., private keys) are compromised. MCU-Token can be easily integrated with various IoT devices by simply adding a short hardware fingerprint-based token to the existing payload. To prevent the reuse of this token, we propose a message mapping approach that binds the token to a specific request via generating the hardware fingerprints based on the request payload. To defeat the machine learning attacks, we mix the valid fingerprints with poisoning data so that attackers cannot train a usable model with the leaked tokens. MCU-Token can defend against armored adversary who may replay, craft, and offload the requests via MitM or use both hardware (e.g., use identical devices) and software (e.g., machine learning attacks) strategies to mimic the fingerprints. The system evaluation shows that MCU-Token can achieve high accuracy (over 97%) with a low overhead across various IoT devices and application scenarios.",

      "abstract": "Constrained IoT devices are becoming ubiquitous in society and there is a need for secure communication protocols that respect the constraints under which these devices operate. EDHOC is an authenticated key establishment protocol for constrained IoT devices, currently being standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). A rudimentary version of EDHOC with only two key establishment methods was formally analyzed in 2018. Since then, the protocol has evolved significantly and several new key establishment methods have been added. In this paper, we present a formal analysis of all EDHOC methods in an enhanced symbolic Dolev-Yao model using the Tamarin tool. We show that not all methods satisfy the authentication notion injective of agreement, but that they all do satisfy a notion of implicit authentication, as well as Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) of the session key material. We identify other weaknesses to which we propose improvements. For example, a party may intend to establish a session key with a certain peer, but end up establishing it with another, trusted but compromised, peer. We communicated our findings and proposals to the IETF, which has incorporated some of these in newer versions of the standard.",

      "abstract": "Many IoT use cases involve constrained battery-powered devices offering services in a RESTful manner to their communication partners. Such services may involve, e.g., costly computations or actuator/sensor usage, which may have significant influence on the power consumption of the service Providers. Remote attackers may excessively use those services in order to exhaust the Providers' batteries, which is a form of a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Previous work proposed solutions based on lightweight symmetric authentication. These solutions scale poorly due to requiring pre-shared keys and do not provide protection against compromised service Requesters. In contrast, we consider more powerful attackers even capable of compromising legit Requesters. We propose a method that combines attacker detection and throttling, conducted by a third trusted Backend, with a lightweight authentication protocol. For attacker detection and throttling, we propose a novel approach using rate limitation algorithms. In addition, we propose and formally verify two authentication protocols suitable for different, widely used IoT network topologies. Our protocols ensure service availability for benign Requesters even if Providers are under a battery exhaustion attack. The protocols do neither require pre-shared keys between Requesters and Providers, nor the usage of asymmetric cryptography and public key infrastructures on the Provider. This makes our protocols suitable for a variety of IoT deployments involving constrained devices and constrained networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of our method through a simulation and a proof of concept implementation.",

Commonly, PUFs are utilised to generate cryptographic keys on-the-fly, replacing the need to store keys in vulnerable, non-volatile memories. Due to the physical nature of PUFs, environmental variations cause noise, manifesting themselves as errors which are apparent in the initial PUF measurements. This necessitates expensive active error correction techniques which can run counter to the goal of lightweight security. ML-based techniques for authenticating noisy PUF measurements were explored as an alternative to error correction techniques, bringing about the concept of a PUF Phenotype, where PUF identity is considered as a structure agnostic representation of the PUF, with relevant noise encoding. This work proposes a full noise-tolerant authentication protocol based on the PUF Phenotype concept and methodology for an Internet-of-Things (IoT) network, demonstrating mutual authentication and forward secrecy in a setting suitable for device-to-device communication. Upon conducting security and performance analyses, it is evident that our proposed scheme demonstrates resilience against various attacks compared to the currently existing PUF protocols.",

However, it also imposes new types of security challenges, including device authentication, traffic types classification, and malicious traffic identification, in the network domain. Traditionally, internet protocol (IP) and media access control (MAC) addresses are utilized for identifying network-connected devices in a network, whilst these addressing schemes are prone to be compromised, including spoofing attacks and MAC randomization. Therefore, device identification using only explicit identifiers is a challenging task. Accurate device identification plays a key role in securing a network. In this paper, a supervised machine learning-based device fingerprinting (DFP) model has been proposed for identifying network-connected IoT devices using only communication traffic characteristics (or implicit identifiers). A single transmission control protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) packet header features have been utilized for generating unique fingerprints, with the fingerprints represented as a vector of 22 features. Experimental results have shown that the proposed DFP method achieves over 98% in classifying individual IoT devices using the UNSW dataset with 22 smart-home IoT devices. This signifies that the proposed approach is invaluable to network operators in making their networks more secure.",

However, the originating number of an SMS can be spoofed. If IoT devices authenticate administrators based on the originating number of an SMS, the authentication is bypassed via SMS origin spoofing. Consequently, IoT devices are at risk of accepting commands from attackers and performing unauthorized actions. Accordingly, in this study, the specifications of major cellular IoT gateways were evaluated by focusing on remote management via SMS, and the authentication bypass hypothesis was verified. The results showed that 25 of the 32 targeted products supported SMS-based remote management, and 20 implemented authentication based on the originating number of the SMS. Furthermore, by spoofing the originating number of the SMS, one product was demonstrated to be remotely exploitable through authentication bypassing. Thus, this study revealed the threats posed by SMS origin spoofing to IoT devices and proved that SMS origin spoofing not only threatens text communication between people but also puts machine communication at risk.",

Existing d2d authentication protocols proposed in the literature are either prone to subversion or are computationally infeasible to be deployed on constrained IoT devices. In view of these challenges, we propose a novel, lightweight, and secure CA protocol that leverages communication channel properties and a tunable mathematical function to generate dynamically changing session keys.

      "abstract": "Next-generation networks aim for comprehensive connectivity, interconnecting humans, machines, devices, and systems seamlessly. This interconnectivity raises concerns about privacy and security, given the potential network-wide impact of a single compromise. To address this challenge, the Zero Trust (ZT) paradigm emerges as a key method for safeguarding network integrity and data confidentiality. This work introduces EPS-CNN, a novel deep-learning-based wireless device identification framework designed to serve as the device authentication layer within the ZT architecture, with a focus on resource-constrained IoT devices. At the core of EPS-CNN, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is utilized to generate the device identity from a unique RF signal representation, known as the Double-Sided Envelope Power Spectrum (EPS), which effectively captures the device-specific hardware characteristics while ignoring device-unrelated information. Experimental evaluations show that the proposed framework achieves over 99%, 93%, and 95% testing accuracy when tested in same-domain (day, location, and channel), cross-day, and cross-location scenarios, respectively. Our findings demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework in enhancing the accuracy, robustness, and adaptability of deep learning-based methods, thus offering a pioneering solution for enabling ZT IoT device identification.",

      "abstract": "Smart city architecture brings all the underlying architectures, i.e., Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT), and Internet of Everything (IoE), together to work as a system under its umbrella. The goal of smart city architecture is to come up with a solution that may integrate all the real-time response applications. However, the cyber-physical space poses threats that can jeopardize the working of a smart city where all the data belonging to people, systems, and processes will be at risk. Various architectures based on centralized and distributed mechanisms support smart cities; however, the security concerns regarding traceability, scalability, security services, platform assistance, and resource management persist. In this paper, private blockchain-based architecture Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT) is proposed. It actively utilizes fog computing for all the users and smart devices connected to a fog node in a particular management system in a smart city, i.e., a smart house or hospital, etc. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been utilized for representation to define smart device attributes. NFTs in the proposed DSCoT architecture provide devices and user authentication (IoT) functionality. DSCoT has been designed to provide a smart city solution that ensures robust security features such as Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), and authorization by defining new attributes and functions for Owner, User, Fog, and IoT devices authentication. The evaluation of the proposed functions and components in terms of Gas consumption and time complexity has shown promising results. Comparatively, the Gas consumption for minting DSCoT NFT showed approximately 27%, and a DSCoT approve() was approximately 11% more efficient than the PUF-based NFT solution.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) connected in the form of Internet of Things (IoT) are vulnerable to various security threats, due to the infrastructure-less deployment of IoT devices. Device-to-Device (D2D) authentication of these networks ensures the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of information in the deployed area. The literature suggests different approaches to address security issues in CPS technologies. However, they are mostly based on centralized techniques or specific system deployments with higher cost of computation and communication. It is therefore necessary to develop an effective scheme that can resolve the security problems in CPS technologies of IoT devices. In this paper, a lightweight Hash-MAC-DSDV (Hash Media Access Control Destination Sequence Distance Vector) routing scheme is proposed to resolve authentication issues in CPS technologies, connected in the form of IoT networks. For this purpose, a CPS of IoT devices (multi-WSNs) is developed from the local-chain and public chain, respectively. The proposed scheme ensures D2D authentication by the Hash-MAC-DSDV mutual scheme, where the MAC addresses of individual devices are registered in the first phase and advertised in the network in the second phase. The proposed scheme allows legitimate devices to modify their routing table and unicast the one-way hash authentication mechanism to transfer their captured data from source towards the destination. Our evaluation results demonstrate that Hash- MAC-DSDV outweighs the existing schemes in terms of attack detection, energy consumption and communication metrics.",

This technology has enabled household devices to have the ability to communicate with the internet and a network comprising of such device can create a home IoT network. Such IoT devices are resource constrained and lack high-level security protocols. Thus, security becomes a major issue for such network systems. One way to secure the networks is through reliable authentication protocols and data transfer mechanism. As the household devices are controllable by the users remotely, they are accessed over the internet. Therefore, there should also be a method to make the communication over the internet between IoT devices and the users more secured. This paper proposes a two-phase authentication protocol for authentication purposes and a VPN based secure channel creation for the communication of the devices in the network. Furthermore, the paper discusses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography as a viable alternative to RSA for a more efficient Key exchange mechanism for low-powered IoT devices in the network.",

For example, software attackers perform code injection and code-reuse attacks on their remote interfaces, and physical access to IoT devices allows to tamper with code in memory, steal confidential Intellectual Property (IP), or mount fault attacks to manipulate a CPU's control flow.   In this work, we present Sponge-based Control Flow Protection (SCFP). SCFP is a stateful, sponge-based scheme to ensure the confidentiality of software IP and its authentic execution on IoT devices. At compile time, SCFP encrypts and authenticates software with instruction-level granularity. During execution, an SCFP hardware extension between the CPU's fetch and decode stage continuously decrypts and authenticates instructions. Sponge-based authenticated encryption in SCFP yields fine-grained control-flow integrity and thus prevents code-reuse, code-injection, and fault attacks on the code and the control flow. In addition, SCFP withstands any modification of software in memory. For evaluation, we extended a RISC-V core with SCFP and fabricated a real System on Chip (SoC). The average overhead in code size and execution time of SCFP on this design is 19.8% and 9.1%, respectively, and thus meets the requirements of embedded IoT devices.",

Also, they are being considered as a viable authentication method for IoT devices such as smart headsets with AR/VR capabilities, wearables, and erables, that do not have a large form factor or the ability to seamlessly interact with the user. Recent behavioural biometric solutions use deep learning models that require large amounts of annotated training data. Collecting such volumes of behaviour biometrics data raises privacy and usability concerns. To this end, we propose using SimSiam-based non-contrastive self-supervised learning to improve the label efficiency of behavioural biometric systems. The key idea is to use large volumes of unlabelled (and anonymised) data to build good feature extractors that can be subsequently used in supervised settings. Using two EEG datasets, we show that at lower amounts of labelled data, non-contrastive learning performs 4%-11% more than conventional methods such as supervised learning and data augmentation. We also show that, in general, self-supervised learning methods perform better than other baselines. Finally, through careful experimentation, we show various modifications that can be incorporated into the non-contrastive learning process to archive high performance.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Fog computing, mobile edge computing and wireless grids has resulted in the widespread deployment of relatively immature technology. These technologies, which will primarily use 5G wireless communication networks, are becoming popular because they can be deployed quickly with little infrastructure and lends themselves to environments utilizing numerous internet connected devices (ICD). Because of the threat of exploitation, these networks have to be protected by a robust security architecture due to these technologies being plagued with security problems. The authentication of smart ICDs to IoT networks is a critical mechanism for achieving security on these new information system platforms. This article identifies an authentication process required for these ICDs, which will need to prove their identity to authenticate to an IoT fog-mobile edge computing (FMEC) cloud network through a wireless grid authentication process. The purpose of this article is to hypothesize a generic authentication methodology for these FMEC clouds uses in an IoT architecture. The proposed methodology, called wg-IoT, must include the integration of Fog computing, wireless grids and mobile edge computing clouds to create this new IoT architecture. An authentication process developed from the resource sharing protocol (RSP) from a wireless grid is first developed and proposed for the authentication of ICDs. The wireless grid core components must be embedded in IoT devices or sensors depending on their capability to handle five primary functions: management of identification [ID] and presence, permissions management, data transferability, application-programming interface [API] and security.",

However, the presence of rogue IoT devices has exposed the IoT to untold risks with severe consequences. The first step in securing the IoT is detecting rogue IoT devices and identifying legitimate ones. Conventional approaches use cryptographic mechanisms to authenticate and verify legitimate devices' identities. However, cryptographic protocols are not available in many systems. Meanwhile, these methods are less effective when legitimate devices can be exploited or encryption keys are disclosed. Therefore, non-cryptographic IoT device identification and rogue device detection become efficient solutions to secure existing systems and will provide additional protection to systems with cryptographic protocols. Non-cryptographic approaches require more effort and are not yet adequately investigated. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on machine learning technologies for the identification of IoT devices along with the detection of compromised or falsified ones from the viewpoint of passive surveillance agents or network operators. We classify the IoT device identification and detection into four categories: device-specific pattern recognition, Deep Learning enabled device identification, unsupervised device identification, and abnormal device detection. Meanwhile, we discuss various ML-related enabling technologies for this purpose. These enabling technologies include learning algorithms, feature engineering on network traffic traces and wireless signals, continual learning, and abnormality detection.",

The leakage of smart devices' unencrypted data can come with the significant cost of a privacy breach. To have a secure channel with encrypted traffic, two endpoints in a network have to authenticate each other and calculate a short-term key. They can then communicate through an authenticated and secure channel. This process is referred to as authenticated key exchange (AKE). Although Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) offers an AKE protocol for IoT networks, research has proposed more efficient and case-specific alternatives. This paper presents LAKEE, a straightforward, lightweight AKE protocol for IoT networks. Our protocol employs elliptic curve cryptography for generating a short-term session key. It reduces the communication and computational overhead of its alternatives while maintaining or improving their security strength.

Forward security and distributed key management are critical breach-resilient countermeasures to mitigate such threats. Yet forward-secure signatures are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoTs, while cloud-assisted approaches suffer from centrality or non-colluding semi-honest servers. In this work, we create two novel digital signatures called Lightweight and Resilient Signatures with Hardware Assistance (LRSHA) and its Forward-secure version (FLRSHA). They offer a near-optimally efficient signing with small keys and signature sizes. We synergize various design strategies, such as commitment separation to eliminate costly signing operations and hardware-assisted distributed servers to enable breach-resilient verification. Our schemes achieve magnitudes of faster forward-secure signing and compact key/signature sizes without suffering from strong security assumptions (non-colluding, central servers) or a heavy burden on the verifier (extreme storage, computation). We formally prove the security of our schemes and validate their performance with full-fledged open-source implementations on both commodity hardware and 8-bit AVR microcontrollers.",

Existing approaches to authenticate these devices limit themselves to dedicated sensors or specified user motions, undermining their widespread acceptance. This paper overcomes these limitations with a general authentication solution by integrating wireless physical layer (PHY) signatures with upper-layer protocols. The key enabling techniques are constructing representative radio propagation profiles from received signals, and developing an adversarial multi-player neural network to accurately recognize underlying radio propagation patterns and facilitate on-body device authentication. Once hearing a suspicious transmission, our system triggers a PHY-based challenge-response protocol to defend in depth against active attacks. We prove that at equilibrium, our adversarial model can extract all information about propagation patterns and eliminate any irrelevant information caused by motion variances and environment changes. We build a prototype of our system using Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) devices and conduct extensive experiments with various static and dynamic body motions in typical indoor and outdoor environments. The experimental results show that our system achieves an average authentication accuracy of 91.6%, with a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.96 and a better generalization performance compared with the conventional non-adversarial approach.",

However, despite their merits, there is a research gap in achieving compatible identity-based and certificateless systems to allow users from different domains (identity-based or certificateless) to communicate seamlessly. Moreover, more efficient constructions can enable their adoption in resource-limited IoTs.

This feature is beneficial for heterogeneous IoT settings (e.g., commercial aerial drones), where different levels of trust/control is assumed on the trusted third party. Our schemes are more communication efficient than their public key based counterparts, as they do not need certificate processing. Our experimental analysis on both commodity and embedded IoT devices show that, only with the cost of having a larger system public key, our cryptosystems are more computation and communication efficient than their certificate-free counterparts.

      "abstract": "With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT), there is a growing need for access control and data protection on low-power, pervasive devices. Biometric-based authentication is promising for IoT due to its convenient nature and lower susceptibility to attacks. However, the costs associated with biometric processing and template protection are nontrivial for smart cards, key fobs, and so forth. In this paper, we discuss the security, cost, and utility of biometric systems and develop two major frameworks for improving them. First, we introduce a new framework for implementing biometric systems based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs) and hardware obfuscation that, unlike traditional software approaches, does not require nonvolatile storage of a biometric template/key. Aside from reducing the risk of compromising the biometric, the nature of obfuscation also provides protection against access control circumvention via malware and fault injection. The PUF provides non-invertibility and non-linkability. Second, a major requirement of the proposed PUF/obfuscation approach is that a reliable (robust) key be generated from the users input biometric. We propose a noiseaware biometric quantization framework capable of generating unique, reliable keys with reduced enrollment time and denoising costs. Finally, we conduct several case studies. In the first, the proposed noise-aware approach is compared to our previous approach for multiple biometric modalities, including popular ones (fingerprint and iris) and emerging cardiovascular ones (ECG and PPG). The results show that ECG provides the best tradeoff between reliability, key length, entropy, and cost. In the second and third case studies, we demonstrate how reliability, denoising costs, and enrollment times can be simultaneously improved by modeling subject intra-variations for ECG.",

      "abstract": "The widespread expansion of the IoT based services are changing peoples living habits. With the vast data generation and intelligent decision support system, an IoT is supporting many industries to improve their products and services. The major challenge for IoT developers is to design a secure data transmission system and a trustworthy inter device and user device communication system. The data starts its journey from the sensing devices and reaches the user dashboard through a different medium. Authentication between two IoT devices provides a reliable and lightweight key generation system. In this paper, we put forward a novel authentication approach for the IoT paradigm. We postulate an ECC based two factor Level Dependent Authentication for Generic IoT (LDA 2IoT) in which users at a particular level in the hierarchy can access the sensors deployed at below or the equal level of the hierarchy. We impart the security analysis for the proposed LDA 2IoT based on the Dolev Yao channel and widely accepted random oracle based ROR model. We provide the implementation of the proposed scheme using the MQTT protocol. Finally, we set forth a performance analysis for the proposed LDA 2IoT system by comparing it with the other existing scheme.",
