      "abstract": "The evolution of smart cities demands scalable, secure, and energy-efficient architectures for real-time data processing. With the number of IoT devices expected to exceed 40 billion by 2030, traditional cloud-based systems are increasingly constrained by bandwidth, latency, and energy limitations. This paper leverages the ROOF (Real-time Onsite Operations Facilitation) framework with decentralized computing at intermediary fog and peripheral edge network layers to reduce latency by processing data near its point of origin. ROOF features fog caching to avoid redundancy, ultra-low-power wireless transmission for energy savings, and AI-driven resource allocation for efficiency. Security is enhanced through TLS encryption, blockchain-based authentication, and edge-level access control. Case studies from Bhubaneswar, Barcelona and Copenhagen validate the use of ROOF in traffic systems and environmental monitoring. The paper concludes by outlining key challenges and prospects of AI-driven analytics in smart urban infrastructure.",

The study explores security threats in smart homes ecosystems, categorizing them into vulnerabilities at the network layer, device level, and those from cloud-based and AI-driven systems. Research findings indicate that post-quantum encryption, coupled with AI-driven anomaly detection, is highly effective in enhancing security; however, computational resource demands present significant challenges. Blockchain authentication together with zero-trust structures builds security resilience, although they need changes to existing infrastructure. The specific security strategies show their effectiveness through ANOVA, Chi-square tests, and Monte Carlo simulations yet lack sufficient scalability according to the results. The research demonstrates the requirement for improvement in cryptographic techniques, alongside AI-enhanced threat detection and adaptive security models which must achieve a balance between performance and efficiency and real-time applicability within smart home ecosystems.",

      "abstract": "Infrastructure maintenance is inherently complex, especially for widely dispersed transport systems like roads and railroads. Maintaining this infrastructure involves multiple partners working together to ensure safe, efficient upkeep that meets technical and safety standards, with timely materials and budget adherence. Traditionally, these requirements are managed on paper, with each contract step checked manually. Smart contracts, based on blockchain distributed ledger technology, offer a new approach. Distributed ledgers facilitate secure, transparent transactions, enabling decentralized agreements where contract terms automatically execute when conditions are met. Beyond financial transactions, blockchains can track complex agreements, recording each stage of contract fulfillment between multiple parties. A smart contract is a set of coded rules stored on the blockchain that automatically executes each term upon meeting specified conditions. In infrastructure maintenance, this enables end-to-end automation-from contractor assignment to maintenance completion. Using an immutable, decentralized record, contract terms and statuses are transparent to all parties, enhancing trust and efficiency. Creating smart contracts for infrastructure requires a comprehensive understanding of procedural workflows to foresee all requirements and liabilities. This workflow includes continuous infrastructure monitoring through a dynamic, data-driven maintenance model that triggers necessary actions. Modern process mining can develop a resilient Maintenance Process Model, helping Operations Management to define contract terms, including asset allocation, logistics, materials, and skill requirements. Automation and reliable data quality across the procedural chain are essential, supported by IoT sensors, big data analytics, predictive maintenance, intelligent logistics, and asset management.",

Blockchain technology provides immutable, scalable, and decentralized solutions to address these challenges, and integrating deep reinforcement learning (DRL) into the IoT environment offers enhanced adaptability and decision-making. This paper investigates the integration of blockchain and DRL to optimize mobile transmission and secure data exchange in IoT-assisted smart cities. Through the clustering and categorization of IoT application systems, the combination of DRL and blockchain is shown to enhance the performance of IoT networks by maintaining privacy and security. Based on the review of papers published between 2015 and 2024, we have classified the presented approaches and offered practical taxonomies, which provide researchers with critical perspectives and highlight potential areas for future exploration and research. Our investigation shows how combining blockchain's decentralized framework with DRL can address privacy and security issues, improve mobile transmission efficiency, and guarantee robust, privacy-preserving IoT systems. Additionally, we explore blockchain integration for DRL and outline the notable applications of DRL technology.

These devices often face resource constraints and may connect to unreliable networks, posing risks to the data they handle. Securing IoT technology is crucial due to the sensitive data involved.   Preventing energy attacks and ensuring the security of IoT infrastructure are key challenges in modern smart homes. Monitoring energy consumption can be an effective approach to detecting abnormal behavior and IoT cyberattacks. Lightweight algorithms are necessary to accommodate the resource limitations of IoT devices.   This paper presents a lightweight technique for detecting energy consumption attacks on smart home devices by analyzing received packets. The proposed algorithm considers TCP, UDP, and MQTT protocols, as well as device statuses (Idle, active, under attack). It accounts for resource constraints and promptly alerts administrators upon detecting an attack. The proposed approach effectively identifies energy consumption attacks by measuring packet reception rates for different protocols.",

The rapid expansion of IoT technology has ushered in smart healthcare, smart devices, smart cities, and smart grids. However, the security of IoT devices, particularly in healthcare, has become a major concern, with recent attacks revealing serious vulnerabilities. In IoT networks, where connected devices are susceptible to resource-constraint attacks, such as energy consumption attacks, security is paramount.   This paper explores the impact of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Fake Access Points (F-APs) attacks on WiFi-enabled smart healthcare devices. Specifically, it investigates how these attacks can disrupt service on victim devices and Access Points (APs), focusing on device connectivity and energy consumption during attacks. Key findings include identifying the attack rates of DDoS attacks that disrupt services and quantifying the energy consumption impact of Energy Consumption Distributed Denial of Service (EC-DDoS) and F-APs attacks on smart healthcare devices.   The study highlights communication protocols, attack rates, payload sizes, and port states of victim devices as critical factors influencing energy consumption. These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of IoT device vulnerabilities in smart healthcare environments and lay the groundwork for future defense strategies.",

      "abstract": "The world has been experiencing rapid urbanization over the last few decades, putting a strain on existing city infrastructure such as waste management, water supply management, public transport and electricity consumption. We are also seeing increasing pollution levels in cities threatening the environment, natural resources and health conditions. However, we must realize that the real growth lies in urbanization as it provides many opportunities to individuals for better employment, healthcare and better education. However, it is imperative to limit the ill effects of rapid urbanization through integrated action plans to enable the development of growing cities. This gave rise to the concept of a smart city in which all available information associated with a city will be utilized systematically for better city management.   The proposed system architecture is divided in subsystems and is discussed in individual chapters. The first chapter introduces and gives overview to the reader of the complete system architecture. The second chapter discusses the data monitoring system and data lake system based on the oneM2M standards. DMS employs oneM2M as a middleware layer to achieve interoperability, and DLS uses a multi-tenant architecture with multiple logical databases, enabling efficient and reliable data management. The third chapter discusses energy monitoring and electric vehicle charging systems developed to illustrate the applicability of the oneM2M standards. The fourth chapter discusses the Data Exchange System based on the Indian Urban Data Exchange framework. DES uses IUDX standard data schema and open APIs to avoid data silos and enable secure data sharing. The fifth chapter discusses the 5D-IoT framework that provides uniform data quality assessment of sensor data with meaningful data descriptions.",

      "abstract": "The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities, intelligent healthcare systems, and various real-world applications have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of data, often analyzed using different Machine Learning (ML) models. Federated learning (FL) has been acknowledged as a privacy-preserving machine learning technology, where multiple parties cooperatively train ML models without exchanging raw data. However, the current FL architecture does not allow for an audit of the training process due to the various data-protection policies implemented by each FL participant. Furthermore, there is no global model verifiability available in the current architecture. This paper proposes a smart contract-based policy control for securing the Federated Learning (FL) management system. First, we develop and deploy a smart contract-based local training policy control on the FL participants' side. This policy control is used to verify the training process, ensuring that the evaluation process follows the same rules for all FL participants. We then enforce a smart contract-based aggregation policy to manage the global model aggregation process. Upon completion, the aggregated model and policy are stored on blockchain-based storage. Subsequently, we distribute the aggregated global model and the smart contract to all FL participants. Our proposed method uses smart policy control to manage access and verify the integrity of machine learning models. We conducted multiple experiments with various machine learning architectures and datasets to evaluate our proposed framework, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.",

      "abstract": "Smart city architecture brings all the underlying architectures, i.e., Internet of Things (IoT), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT), and Internet of Everything (IoE), together to work as a system under its umbrella. The goal of smart city architecture is to come up with a solution that may integrate all the real-time response applications. However, the cyber-physical space poses threats that can jeopardize the working of a smart city where all the data belonging to people, systems, and processes will be at risk. Various architectures based on centralized and distributed mechanisms support smart cities; however, the security concerns regarding traceability, scalability, security services, platform assistance, and resource management persist. In this paper, private blockchain-based architecture Decentralized Smart City of Things (DSCoT) is proposed. It actively utilizes fog computing for all the users and smart devices connected to a fog node in a particular management system in a smart city, i.e., a smart house or hospital, etc. Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have been utilized for representation to define smart device attributes. NFTs in the proposed DSCoT architecture provide devices and user authentication (IoT) functionality. DSCoT has been designed to provide a smart city solution that ensures robust security features such as Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA), and authorization by defining new attributes and functions for Owner, User, Fog, and IoT devices authentication. The evaluation of the proposed functions and components in terms of Gas consumption and time complexity has shown promising results. Comparatively, the Gas consumption for minting DSCoT NFT showed approximately 27%, and a DSCoT approve() was approximately 11% more efficient than the PUF-based NFT solution.",

Though sensor-driven devices have largely eased our everyday lives, most IoT infrastructures have been suffering from security challenges. Since the emergence of IoT, lightweight block ciphers have been a better option for intelligent and sensor-based applications. When public-key infrastructure dominates worldwide, the symmetric key encipherment such as Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) shows immense prospects to sit with the smart home IoT appliances. As investigated, chaos motivated logistic map shows enormous potential to secure IoT aligned real-time data communication. The unpredictability and randomness features of the logistic map in sync with chaos-based scheduling techniques can pave the way to build a particular dynamic key propagation technique for data confidentiality, availability and integrity. After being motivated by the security prospects of AES and chaos cryptography, the paper illustrates a key scheduling technique using a 3-dimensional S-box (substitution-box). The logistic map algorithm has been incorporated to enhance security. The proposed approach has applicability for lightweight IoT devices such as smart home appliances. The work determines how seeming chaos accelerates the desired key-initiation before message transmission. The proposed model is evaluated based on the key generation delay required for the smart-home sensor devices.",

      "abstract": "A city is a large human settlement that serves the people who live there, and a smart city is a concept of how cities might better serve their residents through new forms of technology. In this paper, we focus on four major smart city domains according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs: smart utility, smart transportation, smart homes, and smart healthcare. Numerous IoT applications have been developed to achieve the intelligence that we desire in our smart domains, ranging from personal gadgets such as health trackers and smart watches to large-scale industrial IoT systems such as nuclear and energy management systems. However, many of the existing smart city IoT solutions can be made better by considering the suitability of their security strategies. Inappropriate system security designs generally occur in two scenarios: first, system designers recognize the importance of security but are unsure of where, when, or how to implement it; and second, system designers try to fit traditional security designs to meet the smart city security context. Thus, the objective of this paper is to provide application designers with the missing security link they may need to improve their security designs. By evaluating the specific context of each smart city domain and the context-specific security requirements, we aim to provide directions on when, where, and how they should implement security strategies and the possible security challenges they need to consider. In addition, we present a new perspective on security issues in smart cities from a data-centric viewpoint by referring to the reference architecture, the Activity-Network-Things (ANT)-centric architecture, built upon the concept of \"security in a zero-trust environment\". By doing so, we reduce the security risks posed by new system interactions or unanticipated user behaviors while avoiding the hassle of regularly upgrading security models.",

      "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the disruptive technologies that is shaping the future. It has growing applications for data-driven decisions in major smart city solutions, including transportation, education, healthcare, public governance, and power systems. At the same time, it is gaining popularity in protecting critical cyber infrastructure from cyber threats, attacks, damages, or unauthorized access. However, one of the significant issues of those traditional AI technologies (e.g., deep learning) is that the rapid progress in complexity and sophistication propelled and turned out to be uninterpretable black boxes. On many occasions, it is very challenging to understand the decision and bias to control and trust systems' unexpected or seemingly unpredictable outputs. It is acknowledged that the loss of control over interpretability of decision-making becomes a critical issue for many data-driven automated applications. But how may it affect the system's security and trustworthiness? This chapter conducts a comprehensive study of machine learning applications in cybersecurity to indicate the need for explainability to address this question. While doing that, this chapter first discusses the black-box problems of AI technologies for Cybersecurity applications in smart city-based solutions. Later, considering the new technological paradigm, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), this chapter discusses the transition from black-box to white-box. This chapter also discusses the transition requirements concerning the interpretability, transparency, understandability, and Explainability of AI-based technologies in applying different autonomous systems in smart cities. Finally, it has presented some commercial XAI platforms that offer explainability over traditional AI technologies before presenting future challenges and opportunities.",

In this paper, we propose a lightweight two-layer blockchain mechanism for reliable crossing-domain communication in smart cities. Our mechanism provides a reliable communication mechanism for data sharing and communication between smart cities. We defined a two-layer blockchain structure for the communications inner and between smart cities to achieve reliable communications. We present a new block structure for the lightweight IoT devices. Moreover, we present a reputation-based multi-weight consensus protocol in order to achieve efficient communication while resistant to the nodes collusion attack for the proposed blockchain system. We also conduct a secure analysis to demonstrate the security of the proposed scheme. Finally, performance evaluation shows that our scheme is efficient and practical.",

In this paper we collect and analyze the network traffic generated in a typical smart homes environment consisting of a set of common IoT (and non-IoT) devices. We analyze the network traffic characteristics of IoT devices from three complementary aspects: remote network servers and port numbers that IoT devices connect to, flow-level traffic characteristics such as flow duration, and packet-level traffic characteristics such as packet inter-arrival time. Our study provides critical insights into the operational and behavioral characteristics of IoT devices, which can help develop more effective security and performance algorithms for IoT devices.",

While there has been work on how organisations and individuals manage their own cybersecurity risks, it remains unclear to what extent IoT vendors are supporting end-users to perform day-to-day management of such risks in a usable way, and what is stopping the vendors from improving such support.

These devices are inherently not secure across their comprehensive software, hardware, and network stacks, thus presenting a large attack surface that can be exploited by hackers. In this article, we present an innovative technique for detecting unknown system vulnerabilities, managing these vulnerabilities, and improving incident response when such vulnerabilities are exploited. The novelty of this approach lies in extracting intelligence from known real-world CPS/IoT attacks, representing them in the form of regular expressions, and employing machine learning (ML) techniques on this ensemble of regular expressions to generate new attack vectors and security vulnerabilities. Our results show that 10 new attack vectors and 122 new vulnerability exploits can be successfully generated that have the potential to exploit a CPS or an IoT ecosystem. The ML methodology achieves an accuracy of 97.4% and enables us to predict these attacks efficiently with an 87.2% reduction in the search space. We demonstrate the application of our method to the hacking of the in-vehicle network of a connected car. To defend against the known attacks and possible novel exploits, we discuss a defense-in-depth mechanism for various classes of attacks and the classification of data targeted by such attacks. This defense mechanism optimizes the cost of security measures based on the sensitivity of the protected resource, thus incentivizing its adoption in real-world CPS/IoT by cybersecurity practitioners.",

A smart home is one of the applications for the Internet of Things. In a smart home, household appliances could be monitored and controlled remotely. This raises a demand for reliable security solutions for IoT systems. Authorization and authentication are challenging IoT security operations that need to be considered. For instance, unauthorized access, such as cyber-attacks, to a smart home system could cause danger by controlling sensors and actuators, opening the doors for a thief. This paper applies an extra layer of security of multi-factor authentication to act as a prevention method for mitigating unauthorized access. One of those factors is face recognition, as it has recently become popular due to its non-invasive biometric techniques, which is easy to use with cameras attached to most trending computers and smartphones. In this paper, the gaps in existing IoT smart home systems have been analyzed, and we have suggested improvements for overcoming them by including necessary system modules and enhancing user registration and log-in authentication. We propose software architecture for implementing such a system. To the best of our knowledge, the existing IoT smart home management research does not support face recognition and liveness detection within the authentication operation of their suggested software architectures.",

Although there exists a body of work on IoT security, most of it focuses on securing clients (i.e., IoT devices). However, cloud servers can also be compromised.

This paper presents FIDELIUS: a runtime system for secure cloud-based storage and communication even in the presence of compromised servers. FIDELIUS's design is tailored for smart home systems that have intermittent Internet access. In particular, it supports local control of smart home devices in the event that communication with the cloud is lost, and provides a consistency model using transactions to mitigate inconsistencies that can arise due to network partitions. We have implemented FIDELIUS, developed a smart home benchmark that uses FIDELIUS, and measured FIDELIUS's performance and power consumption. Our experiments show that compared to the commercial Particle.io framework, FIDELIUS reduces more than 50% of the data communication time and increases battery life by 2X. Compared to PyORAM, an alternative (ORAM-based) oblivious storage implementation, FIDELIUS has 4-7X faster access times with 25-43X less data transferred.",

To address this gap, we present a measurement study of smart home IoT devices in the wild by instrumenting home gateways and passively collecting real-world network traffic logs from more than 200 homes across a large metropolitan area in the United States. We characterize smart home IoT traffic in terms of its volume, temporal patterns, and external endpoints along with focusing on certain security and privacy concerns. We first show that traffic characteristics reflect the functionality of smart home IoT devices such as smart TVs generating high volume traffic to content streaming services following diurnal patterns associated with human activity. While the smart home IoT ecosystem seems fragmented, our analysis reveals that it is mostly centralized due to its reliance on a few popular cloud and DNS services. Our findings also highlight several interesting security and privacy concerns in smart home IoT ecosystem such as the need to improve policy-based access control for IoT traffic, lack of use of application layer encryption, and prevalence of third-party advertising and tracking services.

It promises to transform the digital infrastructure which powers extensive evolutions and impacts a lot of areas. Vehicle parking is a major problem in major cities around the world in both developed and developing countries. The common problems are unavailability or shortage of parking spaces, no information about tariff and no mean of searching availability of parking space online. The struggle doesn't end even if an individual finds a spot, he is required to pay in cash. This traditional and manual process takes a lot of time and causes a lot of hassle. In this paper, we provide a novel solution to the parking problem using IoT and distributed ledger technology. This system is based on pervasive computing and provides auto check-in and check-out. The user can control the system and their profile using the app on their smartphone. The major advantage of the system is an easy and online payment method. Users can pay for their parking tickets using their credit cards from their smartphone app. This decreases their hassle of carrying cash and coins for purchasing parking tickets. Smart Parking will optimize the parking mechanism, save time, reduce traffic and pollution, and provide an enhanced user experience. It is robust, secure, scalable and automated using the combination of cutting-edge technologies.",

      "abstract": "Standard security protocols like SSL, TLS, IPSec etc. have high memory and processor consumption which makes all these security protocols unsuitable for resource constrained platforms such as Internet of Things (IoT). Blockchain (BC) finds its efficient application in IoT platform to preserve the five basic cryptographic primitives, such as confidentiality, authenticity, integrity, availability and non-repudiation. Conventional adoption of BC in IoT platform causes high energy consumption, delay and computational overhead which are not appropriate for various resource constrained IoT devices. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) based smart access control framework in a public and a private BC for a smart city application which makes it more efficient as compared to the existing IoT applications. The proposed IoT based smart city architecture adopts BC technology for preserving all the cryptographic security and privacy issues. Moreover, BC has very minimal overhead on IoT platform as well. This work investigates the existing threat models and critical access control issues which handle multiple permissions of various nodes and detects relevant inconsistencies to notify the corresponding nodes. Comparison in terms of all security issues with existing literature shows that the proposed architecture is competitively efficient in terms of security access control.",

      "abstract": "Contemporary IoT environments, such as smart buildings, require end-users to trust data-capturing rules published by the systems. There are several reasons why such a trust is misplaced --- IoT systems may violate the rules deliberately or IoT devices may transfer user data to a malicious third-party due to cyberattacks, leading to the loss of individuals' privacy or service integrity. To address such concerns, we propose IoT Notary, a framework to ensure trust in IoT systems and applications. IoT Notary provides secure log sealing on live sensor data to produce a verifiable `proof-of-integrity,' based on which a verifier can attest that captured sensor data adheres to the published data-capturing rules. IoT Notary is an integral part of TIPPERS, a smart space system that has been deployed at UCI to provide various real-time location-based services in the campus. IoT Notary imposes nominal overheads for verification, thereby users can verify their data of one day in less than two seconds.",

      "abstract": "Future smart cities and intelligent world will have connected vehicles and smart cars as its indispensable and most essential components. The communication and interaction among such connected entities in this vehicular internet of things (IoT) domain, which also involves smart traffic infrastructure, road-side sensors, restaurant with beacons, autonomous emergency vehicles, etc., offer innumerable real-time user applications and provide safer and pleasant driving experience to consumers. Having more than 100 million lines of code and hundreds of sensors, these connected vehicles (CVs) expose a large attack surface, which can be remotely compromised and exploited by malicious attackers. Security and privacy are serious concerns that impede the adoption of smart connected cars, which if not properly addressed will have grave implications with risk to human life and limb. In this research, we present a formalized dynamic groups and attribute-based access control (ABAC) model (referred as \\cvac) for smart cars ecosystem, where the proposed model not only considers system wide attributes-based security policies but also takes into account the individual user privacy preferences for allowing or denying service notifications, alerts and operations to on-board resources. Further, we introduce a novel notion of groups in vehicular IoT, which are dynamically assigned to moving entities like connected cars, based on their current GPS coordinates, speed or other attributes, to ensure relevance of location and time sensitive notification services to the consumers, to provide administrative benefits to manage large numbers of smart entities, and to enable attributes and alerts inheritance for fine-grained security authorization policies. We present proof of concept implementation of our model in AWS cloud platform demonstrating real-world uses cases along with performance metrics.",

      "abstract": "With an enormous range of applications, Internet of Things (IoT) has magnetized industries and academicians from everywhere. IoT facilitates operations through ubiquitous connectivity by providing Internet access to all the devices with computing capabilities. With the evolution of wireless infrastructure, the focus from simple IoT has been shifted to smart, connected and mobile IoT (M-IoT) devices and platforms, which can enable low-complexity, low-cost and efficient computing through sensors, machines, and even crowdsourcing. All these devices can be grouped under a common term of M-IoT. Even though the positive impact on applications has been tremendous, security, privacy and trust are still the major concerns for such networks and an insufficient enforcement of these requirements introduces non-negligible threats to M-IoT devices and platforms. Thus, it is important to understand the range of solutions which are available for providing a secure, privacy-compliant, and trustworthy mechanism for M-IoT. There is no direct survey available, which focuses on security, privacy, trust, secure protocols, physical layer security and handover protections in M-IoT. This paper covers such requisites and presents comparisons of state-the-art solutions for IoT which are applicable to security, privacy, and trust in smart and connected M-IoT networks. Apart from these, various challenges, applications, advantages, technologies, standards, open issues, and roadmap for security, privacy and trust are also discussed in this paper.",

Since SBCs are resource constrained devices, we devise a container-based framework for a lighter foot-print. Kubernetes was used as an orchestration tool to orchestrate various containers in the framework. To validate our approach, we implemented a proof-of-concept of the SBC based Edge cluster for a smart parking application, as a possible IoT use-case.

      "abstract": "A myriad of IoT devices such as bulbs, switches, speakers in a smart home environment allow users to easily control the physical world around them and facilitate their living styles through the sensors already embedded in these devices. Sensor data contains a lot of sensitive information about the user and devices. However, an attacker inside or near a smart home environment can potentially exploit the innate wireless medium used by these devices to exfiltrate sensitive information from the encrypted payload (i.e., sensor data) about the users and their activities, invading user privacy. With this in mind,in this work, we introduce a novel multi-stage privacy attack against user privacy in a smart environment. It is realized utilizing state-of-the-art machine-learning approaches for detecting and identifying the types of IoT devices, their states, and ongoing user activities in a cascading style by only passively sniffing the network traffic from smart home devices and sensors. The attack effectively works on both encrypted and unencrypted communications. We evaluate the efficiency of the attack with real measurements from an extensive set of popular off-the-shelf smart home IoT devices utilizing a set of diverse network protocols like WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE. Our results show that an adversary passively sniffing the traffic can achieve very high accuracy (above 90%) in identifying the state and actions of targeted smart home devices and their users. To protect against this privacy leakage, we also propose a countermeasure based on generating spoofed traffic to hide the device states and demonstrate that it provides better protection than existing solutions.",

      "abstract": "While the smart surveillance system enhanced by the Internet of Things (IoT) technology becomes an essential part of Smart Cities, it also brings new concerns in security of the data. Compared to the traditional surveillance systems that is built following a monolithic architecture to carry out lower level operations, such as monitoring and recording, the modern surveillance systems are expected to support more scalable and decentralized solutions for advanced video stream analysis at the large volumes of distributed edge devices. In addition, the centralized architecture of the conventional surveillance systems is vulnerable to single point of failure and privacy breach owning to the lack of protection to the surveillance feed. This position paper introduces a novel secure smart surveillance system based on microservices architecture and blockchain technology. Encapsulating the video analysis algorithms as various independent microservices not only isolates the video feed from different sectors, but also improve the system availability and robustness by decentralizing the operations. The blockchain technology securely synchronizes the video analysis databases among microservices across surveillance domains, and provides tamper proof of data in the trustless network environment. Smart contract enabled access authorization strategy prevents any unauthorized user from accessing the microservices and offers a scalable, decentralized and fine-grained access control solution for smart surveillance systems.",

      "abstract": "The emerging Internet of Things (IoT) is facing significant scalability and security challenges. On the one hand, IoT devices are \"weak\" and need external assistance. Edge computing provides a promising direction addressing the deficiency of centralized cloud computing in scaling massive number of devices. On the other hand, IoT devices are also relatively \"vulnerable\" facing malicious hackers due to resource constraints. The emerging blockchain and smart contracts technologies bring a series of new security features for IoT and edge computing. In this paper, to address the challenges, we design and prototype an edge-IoT framework named \"EdgeChain\" based on blockchain and smart contracts. The core idea is to integrate a permissioned blockchain and the internal currency or \"coin\" system to link the edge cloud resource pool with each IoT device' account and resource usage, and hence behavior of the IoT devices. EdgeChain uses a credit-based resource management system to control how much resource IoT devices can obtain from edge servers, based on pre-defined rules on priority, application types and past behaviors. Smart contracts are used to enforce the rules and policies to regulate the IoT device behavior in a non-deniable and automated manner. All the IoT activities and transactions are recorded into blockchain for secure data logging and auditing. We implement an EdgeChain prototype and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the ideas. The results show that while gaining the security benefits of blockchain and smart contracts, the cost of integrating them into EdgeChain is within a reasonable and acceptable range.",

Drone applications, such as infrastructure technology, security mechanisms, and resource delivery, are just the starting point. More complex tasks are possible through the use of UAV swarms. These tasks increase the potential impacts that drones will have on smart cities, modern cities which have fully adopted technology in order to enhance daily operations as well as the welfare of it's citizens. Smart cities not only consist of static mesh networks of sensors, but can contain dynamic aspects as well including both ground and air based autonomous vehicles. Networked computational devices require paramount security to ensure the safety of a city. To accomplish such high levels of security, services rely on secure-by-design protocols, impervious to security threats. Given the large number of sensors, autonomous vehicles, and other advancements, smart cities necessitates this level of security. The SHARK protocol (Secure, Heterogeneous, Autonomous, and Rotational Knowledge for Swarms) ensures this kind of security by allowing for new applications for UAV swarm technology. Enabling drones to circle a target without a centralized control or selecting lead agents, the SHARKS protocol performs organized movement among agents without creating a central point for attackers to target. Through comparisons on the stability of the protocol in different settings, experiments demonstrate the efficiency and capacity of the SHARKS protocol.",

Key ideas are to utilise network communication to inter-connect public authorities; but also to deploy and integrate numerous sensors and actuators throughout the city infrastructure - which is also widely known as the Internet of Things (IoT). Thus, IoT technologies will be an integral part and key enabler to achieve many objectives of the Smart City vision.   The contributions of this paper are as follows. We first examine a number of IoT platforms, technologies and network standards that can help to foster a Smart City environment. Second, we introduce the EU project MONICA which aims for demonstration of large-scale IoT deployments at public, inner-city events and give an overview on its IoT platform architecture.

In connection with this, it has become the responsibility of the government to ensure a quality standard of living in the cities and also make sure that these facilities trickle down to the next generation. A program named Smart City Mission has been started for this purpose. With an extremely diverse population, that is only second to China in the world in terms of size, the Indian government has engaged in serious thinking for a better city planning and providing numerous opportunities for the citizenry. It was, therefore, planned that the Smart City Mission program will be able to provide a highly responsive infrastructure, network security, a good living environment and the like. Internet of things (IoT) application in smart cities turns out to be the most challenging in this phase. The information available in the internet has made accessible to many devices through IoT and it also aware the citizen in many aspects. But with the increasing number of devices and information, it is now becoming increasingly difficult to depend on IoT to manage things in the internet space with a similar degree of ease. As a result, cloud-based technologies have given preferences over the existing one and IoT has been replaced by the newly introduced Cloud of Things (CoT) paradigm. This paper intends to connect different smart city applications for the betterment of city life with the Cloud of Things (CoT). Our proposed smart city architecture is based on Cloud of Things, and the focus is also given to identify the existing as well as the forthcoming challenges for the concerned program of the government. By identifying the difficulties it is expected that the project will be materialized with a great success.",

In particular, the Named Data Networking (NDN) project (one of the ICN architecture flavors) offers features exploitable by IoT applications, such as stateful forwarding, in- network caching, and built-in assurance of data provenance. Though NDN-based IoT frameworks have been proposed, none have adequately and holistically addressed concerns related to secure onboarding and routing. Additionally, emerging IoT applications such as smart cities require high scalability and thus pose new challenges to NDN routing. Therefore, in this work, we propose and evaluate a novel, scalable framework for lightweight authentication and hierarchical routing in the NDN IoT (ND- NoT). Our ns-3 based simulation analyses demonstrate that our framework is scalable and efficient. It supports deployment densities as high as 40,000 nodes/km2 with an average onboarding convergence time of around 250 seconds and overhead of less than 20 KiB per node. This demonstrates its efficacy for emerging large-scale IoT applications such as smart cities.",

      "abstract": "Smart cities rely on dynamic and real-time data to enable smart urban applications such as intelligent transport and epidemics detection. However, the streaming of big data from IoT devices, especially from mobile platforms like pedestrians and cars, raises significant privacy concerns.   Future autonomous vehicles will generate, collect and consume significant volumes of data to be utilized in delivering safe and efficient transportation solutions. The sensed data will, inherently, contain personally identifiable and attributable information - both external (other vehicles, environmental) and internal (driver, passengers, devices).   The autonomous vehicles are connected to the infrastructure cloud (e.g., Amazon), the edge cloud, and also the mobile cloud (vehicle to vehicle). Clearly these different entities must co-operate and interoperate in a timely fashion when routing and transferring the highly dynamic data. In order to maximise the availability and utility of the sensed data, stakeholders must have confidence that the data they transmit, receive, aggregate and reason on is appropriately secured and protected throughout. There are many different metaphors for providing end-to-end security for data exchanges, but they commonly require a management and control sidechannel.   This work proposes a scalable smart city privacy-preserving architecture named Authorized Analytics that enables each node (e.g. vehicle) to divulge (contextually) local privatised data. Authorized Analytics is shown to scale gracefully to IoT scope deployments.",
