      "abstract": "The advent of Industrial IoT (IIoT) along with Cloud computing has brought a huge paradigm shift in manufacturing industries resulting in yet another industrial revolution, Industry 4.0. Huge amounts of delay-sensitive data of diverse nature are being generated which needs to be locally processed and secured due to its sensitivity. But, the low-end IoT devices are unable to handle huge computational overheads. Also, the semi-trusted nature of Cloud introduces several security concerns. To address these issues, this work proposes a secure Fog-based IIoT architecture by suitably plugging a number of security features into it and by offloading some of the tasks judiciously to fog nodes. These features secure the system alongside reducing the trust and burden on the cloud and resource-constrained devices respectively. We validate our proposed architecture through both theoretical overhead analysis and practical experimentation including simulation study and testbed implementation.",

      "abstract": "Digitalization affects all industrial domains and causes disruption of various business models. Especially in domains such as logistics and manufacturing, inter-connected devices and near-realtime exchange of sensor data across enterprises allows to speed up processes, reduce costs and respond to customer's needs. However, the advent of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) also raises challenges with respect to security and privacy of sensitive and personal data that is created by sensors and processed by services hosted in different administrative domains. The Industrial Data Space initiative addresses these challenges and proposes a secure edge gateway platform named \"Trusted Connector\". In this report, we introduce the main security building blocks of the Trusted Connector and point out how they help protecting business-critical data and preserving the user's privacy.",

      "abstract": "The advances of cloud computing, fog computing and Internet of Things (IoT) make the industries more prosperous than ever. A wide range of industrial systems such as transportation systems and manufacturing systems have been developed by integrating cloud computing, fog computing and IoT successfully. Security and privacy issues are a major concern that hinders the wide adoptions of these novel techniques. In this paper, we focus on assured data deletion, an issue which is important but received less attention in academia and industry. We firstly propose a framework to integrate the cloud, the fog and the things together to manage the stored data from industries or individuals. We then focus on secure data deletion in this framework by proposing an assured data deletion scheme which fulfills fine-grained access control over sensitive data and verifiable data deletion. Only the data owners and the fog devices are involved when deleting a data key and validating the data deletion, which makes the protocol practical due to the features of low latency and real-time interaction of fog computing. The proposed protocol takes advantage of attribute-based encryption and is provably secure under the standard model. The theoretical analysis shows the good performance and functionality requirements while the implementation results demonstrate the feasibility of our proposal.",

      "abstract": "Industrial IoT (IIoT) aims to enhance services provided by various industries such as manufacturing and product processing. IIoT suffers from various challenges and security is one of the key challenge among those challenges. Authentication and access control are two notable challenges for any Industrial IoT (IIoT) based industrial deployment. Any IoT based Industry 4.0 enterprise designs networks between hundreds of tiny devices such as sensors, actuators, fog devices and gateways. Thus, articulating a secure authentication protocol between sensing devices or a sensing device and user devices is an essential step in IoT security. In this paper, first, we present cryptanalysis for the certificate-based scheme proposed for similar environment by Das et al. and prove that their scheme is vulnerable to various traditional attacks such as device anonymity, MITM, and DoS. We then put forward an inter-device authentication scheme using an ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography) that is highly secure and lightweight compared to other schemes for a similar environment. Furthermore, we set forth a formal security analysis using the random oracle based ROR model and informal security analysis over the Doleve-Yao channel. In this paper, we present the comparison of the proposed scheme with existing schemes based on communication cost, computation cost and security index to prove that the proposed EBAKE-SE is highly efficient, reliable, and trustworthy compared to other existing schemes for inter-device authentication. At long last, we present an implementation for the proposed EBAKE-SE using MQTT protocol",

      "abstract": "Secure and efficient communication to establish a seamless nexus between the five levels of a typical automation pyramid is paramount to Industry 4.0. Specifically, vertical and horizontal integration of these levels is an overarching requirement to accelerate productivity and improve operational activities. Vertical integration can improve visibility, flexibility, and productivity by connecting systems and applications. Horizontal integration can provide better collaboration and adaptability by connecting internal production facilities, multi-site operations, and third-party partners in a supply chain. In this paper, we propose an Edge-computing-based Industrial Gateway for interfacing information technology and operational technology that can enable Industry 4.0 vertical and horizontal integration. Subsequently, we design and develop a working prototype to demonstrate a remote production-line maintenance use case with a strong focus on security aspects and the edge paradigm to bring computational resources and data storage closer to data sources.",

This paper unpacks where emerging security risks lie for the industrial internet of things, drawing on both technical and regulatory perspectives. Legal changes are being ushered by the European Union (EU) Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive 2016 and the General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) (both to be enforced from May 2018). We use the case study of the emergent smart energy supply chain to frame, scope out and consolidate the breadth of security concerns at play, and the regulatory responses. We argue the industrial IoT brings four security concerns to the fore, namely: appreciating the shift from offline to online infrastructure; managing temporal dimensions of security; addressing the implementation gap for best practice; and engaging with infrastructural complexity. Our goal is to surface risks and foster dialogue to avoid the emergence of an Internet of Insecure Industrial Things",

      "abstract": "Widespread interest in the emerging area of predictive analytics is driving industries such as manufacturing to explore new approaches to the collection and management of data provided from Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices. Often, analytics processing for Business Intelligence (BI) is an intensive task, and it also presents both an opportunity for competitive advantage as well as a security vulnerability in terms of the potential for losing Intellectual Property (IP). This article explores two approaches to securing BI in the manufacturing domain. Simulation results indicate that a Unified Threat Management (UTM) model is simpler to maintain and has less potential vulnerabilities than a distributed security model. Conversely, a distributed model of security out-performs the UTM model and offers more scope for the use of existing hardware resources. In conclusion, a hybrid security model is proposed where security controls are segregated into a multi-cloud architecture.",

      "abstract": "Industry 4.0 will only become a reality through the convergence of Operational and Information Technologies (OT & IT), which use different computation and communication technologies. Cloud Computing cannot be used for OT involving industrial applications, since it cannot guar-antee stringent non-functional requirements, e.g., dependability, trustworthiness and timeliness. Instead, a new computing paradigm, called Fog Computing, is envisioned as an architectural means to realize the IT/OT convergence. In this paper we propose a Fog Computing Platform (FCP) reference architecture targeting Industrial IoT applications. The FCP is based on: deter-ministic virtualization that reduces the effort required for safety and security assurance; middle-ware for supporting both critical control and dynamic Fog applications; deterministic networking and interoperability, using open standards such as IEEE 802.1 Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA); mechanisms for resource management and or-chestration; and services for security, fault tolerance and distributed machine learning. We pro-pose a methodology for the definition and the evaluation of the reference architecture. We use the Architecture Analysis Design Language (AADL) to model the FCP reference architecture, and a set of industrial use cases to evaluate its suitability for the Industrial IoT area.",

      "abstract": "Industrial Control System (ICS) is a general term that includes supervisory control & data acquisition (SCADA) systems, distributed control systems (DCS), and other control system configurations such as programmable logic controllers (PLC). ICSs are often found in the industrial sectors and critical infrastructures, such as nuclear and thermal plants, water treatment facilities, power generation, heavy industries, and distribution systems. Though ICSs were kept isolated from the Internet for so long, significant achievable business benefits are driving a convergence between ICSs and the Internet as well as information technology (IT) environments, such as cloud computing. As a result, ICSs have been exposed to the attack vectors used in the majority of cyber-attacks. However, ICS devices are inherently much less secure against such advanced attack scenarios. A compromise to ICS can lead to enormous physical damage and danger to human lives. In this work, we have a close look at the shift of the ICS from stand-alone systems to cloud-based environments. Then we discuss the major works, from industry and academia towards the development of the secure ICSs, especially applicability of the machine learning techniques for the ICS cyber-security. The work may help to address the challenges of securing industrial processes, particularly while migrating them to the cloud environments.",

      "abstract": "With the advent of smart industry, Industrial Control Systems (ICS) are increasingly using Cloud, IoT, and other services to meet Industry 4.0 targets. The connectivity inherent in these services exposes such systems to increased cybersecurity risks. To protect ICSs against cyberattacks, intrusion detection systems and intrusion prevention systems empowered by machine learning are used to detect abnormal behavior of the systems. Operational ICSs are not safe environments to research intrusion detection systems due to the possibility of catastrophic risks. Therefore, realistic ICS testbeds enable researchers to analyze and validate their intrusion detection algorithms in a controlled environment. Although various ICS testbeds have been developed, researchers' access to a low-cost, adaptable, and customizable testbed that can accurately simulate industrial control systems and suits security research is still an important issue.   In this paper, we present ICSSIM, a framework for building customized virtual ICS security testbeds, in which various types of cyber threats and attacks can be effectively and efficiently investigated. This framework contains base classes to simulate control system components and communications. ICSSIM aims to produce extendable, versatile, reproducible, low-cost, and comprehensive ICS testbeds with realistic details and high fidelity. ICSSIM is built on top of the Docker container technology, which provides realistic network emulation and runs ICS components on isolated private operating system kernels. ICSSIM reduces the time for developing ICS components and offers physical process modelling using software and hardware in the loop simulation. We demonstrated ICSSIM by creating a testbed and validating its functionality by showing how different cyberattacks can be applied.",
