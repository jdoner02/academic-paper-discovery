      "abstract": "With the advancement of technology, devices, which are considered non-traditional in terms of internet capabilities, are now being embedded in microprocessors to communicate and these devices are known as IoT devices. This technology has enabled household devices to have the ability to communicate with the internet and a network comprising of such device can create a home IoT network. Such IoT devices are resource constrained and lack high-level security protocols. Thus, security becomes a major issue for such network systems. One way to secure the networks is through reliable authentication protocols and data transfer mechanism. As the household devices are controllable by the users remotely, they are accessed over the internet. Therefore, there should also be a method to make the communication over the internet between IoT devices and the users more secured. This paper proposes a two-phase authentication protocol for authentication purposes and a VPN based secure channel creation for the communication of the devices in the network. Furthermore, the paper discusses the Elliptic Curve Cryptography as a viable alternative to RSA for a more efficient Key exchange mechanism for low-powered IoT devices in the network.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, critical infrastructure and power grids have experienced a series of cyber-attacks, leading to temporary, widespread blackouts of considerable magnitude. Since most substations are unmanned and have limited physical security protection, cyber breaches into power grid substations present a risk. Nowadays, software-defined network (SDN), a popular virtual network technology based on the OpenFlow protocol is being widely used in the substation automation system. However, the susceptibility of SDN architecture to cyber-attacks has exhibited a notable increase in recent years, as indicated by research findings. This suggests a growing concern regarding the potential for cybersecurity breaches within the SDN framework. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)-integrated SDN architecture for detecting and preventing the injection of malicious IEC 61850-based generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) messages in a digital substation. Additionally, this program locates the fault's location and, as a form of mitigation, disables a certain port. Furthermore, implementation examples are demonstrated and verified using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed that mimics the functioning of a digital substation.",

      "abstract": "The rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, Fog computing, mobile edge computing and wireless grids has resulted in the widespread deployment of relatively immature technology. These technologies, which will primarily use 5G wireless communication networks, are becoming popular because they can be deployed quickly with little infrastructure and lends themselves to environments utilizing numerous internet connected devices (ICD). Because of the threat of exploitation, these networks have to be protected by a robust security architecture due to these technologies being plagued with security problems. The authentication of smart ICDs to IoT networks is a critical mechanism for achieving security on these new information system platforms. This article identifies an authentication process required for these ICDs, which will need to prove their identity to authenticate to an IoT fog-mobile edge computing (FMEC) cloud network through a wireless grid authentication process. The purpose of this article is to hypothesize a generic authentication methodology for these FMEC clouds uses in an IoT architecture. The proposed methodology, called wg-IoT, must include the integration of Fog computing, wireless grids and mobile edge computing clouds to create this new IoT architecture. An authentication process developed from the resource sharing protocol (RSP) from a wireless grid is first developed and proposed for the authentication of ICDs. The wireless grid core components must be embedded in IoT devices or sensors depending on their capability to handle five primary functions: management of identification [ID] and presence, permissions management, data transferability, application-programming interface [API] and security.",

      "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a key technology for next generation wireless broadband networks showing rapid progress and inspiring numerous compelling applications. A WMN comprises of a set of mesh routers (MRs) and mesh clients (MCs), where MRs are connected to the Internet backbone through the Internet gateways (IGWs). The MCs are wireless devices and communicate among themselves over possibly multi-hop paths with or without the involvement of MRs. User privacy and security have been primary concerns in WMNs due to their peer-to-peer network topology, shared wireless medium, stringent resource constraints, and highly dynamic environment. Moreover, to support real-time applications, WMNs must also be equipped with robust, reliable and efficient communication protocols so as to minimize the end-to-end latency and packet drops. Design of a secure and efficient communication protocol for WMNs, therefore, is of paramount importance. In this paper, we propose a security and privacy protocol that provides security and user anonymity while maintaining communication efficiency in a WMN. The security protocol ensures secure authentication and encryption in access and the backbone networks. The user anonymity, authentication and data privacy is achieved by application of a protocol that is based on Rivest's ring signature scheme. Simulation results demonstrate that while the protocols have minimal storage and communication overhead, they are robust and provide high level of security and privacy to the users of the network services.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid is a large complex network with a myriad of vulnerabilities, usually operated in adversarial settings and regulated based on estimated system states. In this study, we propose a novel highly secure distributed dynamic state estimation mechanism for wide-area (multi-area) smart grids, composed of geographically separated subregions, each supervised by a local control center. We firstly propose a distributed state estimator assuming regular system operation, that achieves near-optimal performance based on the local Kalman filters and with the exchange of necessary information between local centers. To enhance the security, we further propose to (i) protect the network database and the network communication channels against attacks and data manipulations via a blockchain (BC)-based system design, where the BC operates on the peer-to-peer network of local centers, (ii) locally detect the measurement anomalies in real-time to eliminate their effects on the state estimation process, and (iii) detect misbehaving (hacked/faulty) local centers in real-time via a distributed trust management scheme over the network. We provide theoretical guarantees regarding the false alarm rates of the proposed detection schemes, where the false alarms can be easily controlled. Numerical studies illustrate that the proposed mechanism offers reliable state estimation under regular system operation, timely and accurate detection of anomalies, and good state recovery performance in case of anomalies.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-physical system (CPS) security for the smart grid enables secure communication for the SCADA and wide-area measurement system data. Power utilities world-wide use various SCADA protocols, namely DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850, for the data exchanges across substation field devices, remote terminal units (RTUs), and control center applications. Adversaries may exploit compromised SCADA protocols for the reconnaissance, data exfiltration, vulnerability assessment, and injection of stealthy cyberattacks to affect power system operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to generate robust rule sets. We integrate the rule sets into an intrusion detection system (IDS), which continuously monitors the DNP3 data traffic at a substation network and detects intrusions and anomalies in real-time. To enable CPS-aware wide-area situational awareness, we integrated the methodology into an open-source distributed-IDS (D-IDS) framework. The D-IDS facilitates central monitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed substations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different types of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are generated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules in different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules, and the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber Lab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models. After successful testing and evaluation, knowledge and implementation are transferred to field deployment.",

Until now, various protocols have been proposed, and these protocols are being introduced and operated not only in smart grid, but also in smart cities, healthcare, and vehicle ad hoc networks. In this paper, we analyzed the security properties of two recently proposed pairing-free certificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocols for Smart grid.

Wired networks are highly scala-ble and secure, but they are neither cost effective nor dynamic in nature. Wireless communication technologies on the other hand are easy to deploy, low cost etc. but they are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. In order to optimize cost, power consumption, dynamic nature, accuracy and scalability a hybrid communication network is designed in this paper where a portion of the communication network is built using wireless sensor networks (WSN) and the rest is a wired network of fiber optic channels. To offer seamless opera-tion of the hybrid communication network and provide security a Secure Smart Grid Monitoring Technique (SSGMT) is also proposed. The perfor-mance of the proposed hybrid CII for the generation and transmission sys-tem of power grid coupled with the SSGMT during different cyber-attacks is tested using NS2 simulator.

      "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation wireless networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to service providers. As WMNs become an increasingly popular replacement technology for last-mile connectivity to the home networking, community and neighborhood networking, it is imperative to design efficient and secure communication protocols for these networks. However, several vulnerabilities exist in currently existing protocols for WMNs. These security loopholes can be exploited by potential attackers to launch attack on WMNs. The absence of a central point of administration makes securing WMNs even more challenging. The broadcast nature of transmission and the dependency on the intermediate nodes for multi-hop communications lead to several security vulnerabilities in WMNs. The attacks can be external as well as internal in nature. External attacks are launched by intruders who are not authorized users of the network. For example, an intruding node may eavesdrop on the packets and replay those packets at a later point of time to gain access to the network resources. On the other hand, the internal attacks are launched by the nodes that are part of the WMN. On example of such attack is an intermediate node dropping packets which it was supposed to forward. This chapter presents a comprehensive discussion on the current authentication and privacy protection schemes for WMN. In addition, it proposes a novel security protocol for node authentication and message confidentiality and an anonymization scheme for privacy protection of users in WMNs.",

      "abstract": "Smart metering infrastructure (SMI) is the core component of the smart grid (SG) which enables two-way communication between consumers and utility companies to control, monitor, and manage the energy consumption data. Despite their salient features, SMIs equipped with information and communication technology are associated with new threats due to their dependency on public communication networks. Therefore, the security of SMI communications raises the need for robust authentication and key agreement primitives that can satisfy the security requirements of the SG. Thus, in order to realize the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a lightweight and secure authentication protocol, \"LiSA\", primarily to secure SMIs in SG setups. The protocol employs Elliptic Curve Cryptography at its core to provide various security features such as mutual authentication, anonymity, replay protection, session key security, and resistance against various attacks. Precisely, LiSA exploits the hardness of the Elliptic Curve Qu Vanstone (EVQV) certificate mechanism along with Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Problem (ECDHP) and Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). Additionally, LiSA is designed to provide the highest level of security relative to the existing schemes with least computational and communicational overheads. For instance, LiSA incurred barely 11.826 ms and 0.992 ms for executing different passes across the smart meter and the service providers. Further, it required a total of 544 bits for message transmission during each session.",

The communication between the power supplier and power customers is a key issue in smart grid. Performance degradation like delay or outage may cause significant impact on the stability of the pricing based control and thus the reward of smart grid. Therefore, a QoS mechanism is proposed for the communication system in smart grid, which incorporates the derivation of QoS requirement and applies QoS routing in the communication network. For deriving the QoS requirement, the dynamics of power load and the load-price mapping are studied. The corresponding impacts of different QoS metrics like delay are analyzed. Then, the QoS is derived via an optimization problem that maximizes the total revenue. Based on the derived QoS requirement, a simple greedy QoS routing algorithm is proposed for the requirement of high speed routing in smart grid. It is also proven that the proposed greedy algorithm is a $K$-approximation. Numerical simulation shows that the proposed mechanism and algorithm can effectively derive and secure the communication QoS in smart grid.",

Networking technology with different network topologies is one of the important means to solve network security problems. The security of VPN is based on the division of geographical boundaries, but the granularity is relatively coarse, which is difficult to cope with the dynamic changes of the security situation. Zero trust network solves the VPN problem through peer to peer authorization and continuous verification, but most of the solutions use a central proxy device, resulting in the central node becoming the bottleneck of the network. This paper put forward the hard-Nat traversal formula based on the birthday paradox, which solves the long-standing problem of hard NAT traversal. A full mesh networking mechanism with variable parameter full-dimensional spatial peer-to-peer grid topology was proposed, which covers all types of networking schemes and achieve peer-2-peer resource interconnection on both methodological and engineering level.",

      "abstract": "Security has become a main concern for the smart grid to move from research and development to industry. The concept of security has usually referred to resistance to threats by an active or passive attacker. However, since smart meters (SMs) are often placed in unprotected areas, physical security has become one of the important security goals in the smart grid. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have been largely utilized for ensuring physical security in recent years, though their reliability has remained a major problem to be practically used in cryptographic applications. Although fuzzy extractors have been considered as a solution to solve the reliability problem of PUFs, they put a considerable computational cost to the resource-constrained SMs. To that end, we first propose an on-chip-error-correcting (OCEC) PUF that efficiently generates stable digits for the authentication process. Afterward, we introduce a lightweight authentication protocol between the SMs and neighborhood gateway (NG) based on the proposed PUF. The provable security analysis shows that not only the proposed protocol can stand secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary model but also provides additional security features. Also, the performance evaluation demonstrates the significant improvement of the proposed scheme in comparison with the state-of-the-art.",

KLJN has the potential to revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security. Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links, KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient satellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats, including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative, particularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.",

      "abstract": "Smart grids are replacing conventional power grids due to rising electricity use, failing infrastructure, and reliability problems. Two-way communication, demand-side administration, and real-time pricing make smart grids (SGs) dependent on its communication system. Manual network administration slows down SG communication. SG networks additionally utilize hardware and software from several vendors, allowing devices to communicate. Software-defined SGs (SD-SG) use software-defined networking (SDN) to monitor and regulate SG global communication networks to address these concerns. SDN separates the data plane (routers and switches) from the control plane (routing logic) and centralizes control into the SDN controller. This helps network operators manage visibility, control, and security. These benefits have made SDN popular in SG architectural and security studies. But because SD-SGs are vulnerable to cyberattacks, there are concerns about the security of these SD-SG networks. Cybercriminals can attack software-defined communication networks, affecting the power grid. Unauthorized access can be used to intercept messages and introduce false data into system measurements, flood communication channels with fraudulent data packets, or target controllers, a potential single point of failure, to cripple SDN networks. Current research reflects this paradigm as defense and security against such attacks have developed and evolved. There is a need for a current study that provides a more detailed analysis and description of SD-SG network security dangers and countermeasures, as well as future research needs and developing threats for the sector. To fill this void, this survey is presented.",

The performance of the proposed network model de-signed for a smart grid of IEEE 118-Bus system coupled with the secure routing technique is tested during cyber-attacks by means of NS2 and the simulation results indicate that it performs better than existing smart grid monitoring methods like Lo-ADI [1] with respect to packet drop count and throughput.",

      "abstract": "The current power grid is no longer a feasible solution due to ever-increasing user demand of electricity, old infrastructure, and reliability issues and thus require transformation to a better grid a.k.a., smart grid (SG). The key features that distinguish SG from the conventional electrical power grid are its capability to perform two-way communication, demand side management, and real time pricing. Despite all these advantages that SG will bring, there are certain issues which are specific to SG communication system. For instance, network management of current SG systems is complex, time consuming, and done manually. Moreover, SG communication (SGC) system is built on different vendor specific devices and protocols. Therefore, the current SG systems are not protocol independent, thus leading to interoperability issue. Software defined network (SDN) has been proposed to monitor and manage the communication networks globally. This article serves as a comprehensive survey on SDN-based SGC. In this article, we first discuss taxonomy of advantages of SDNbased SGC.We then discuss SDN-based SGC architectures, along with case studies. Our article provides an in-depth discussion on routing schemes for SDN-based SGC. We also provide detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to SDN-based SGC. We furthermore present challenges, open issues, and future research directions related to SDN-based SGC.",

      "abstract": "Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.",

The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Possible areas of development for this work are related to research on improving encryption algorithms (increasing key length, using asymmetric ciphers, etc.), comparing their performance, and implementing a complete data exchange protocol. During the work there were problems in the implementation of encryption algorithms on low-power processors. During the work, a number of issues were resolved regarding type reduction, addressing, memory space, buffer overflow, and more. Issues resolved with reconciliation of receiver and transmitter operation. Examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and decryption of different devices based on Pololu Wixel are given in the paper. The basic task of building a secure communication channel by encrypting data in the channel was solved and firmware and application software were obtained to fully validate the devices. In addition, this work has great application potential, since the implementation of encryption in existing systems will have a small impact on implementation and will not affect the project budget, but will dramatically improve the security of data transmission in these networks. The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Continuing this work may be to test the performance of other protocols on this and similar hardware for systems that may be embedded in short-range wireless communication projects of short-range standards.",

The VPN services route the client's traffic over an encrypted tunnel to a VPN gateway in the cloud. Thus, they hide the client's real IP address from online services, and they also shield the user's connections from perceived threats in the access networks. In this paper, we study the security of such commercial VPN services. The focus is on how the client applications set up VPN tunnels, and how the service providers instruct users to configure generic client software. We analyze common VPN protocols and implementations on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. We find that the VPN clients have various configuration flaws, which an attacker can exploit to strip off traffic encryption or to bypass authentication of the VPN gateway. In some cases, the attacker can also steal the VPN user's username and password. We suggest ways to mitigate each of the discovered vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to the service providers. Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point (AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are required to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to the wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that do not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are connected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to conventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other networks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for WMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols for WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all assumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does not hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in WMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First, it identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and the network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality, data integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed. Then various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed. After enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network layer, the chapter briefly discusses on some of the preventive mechanisms for these attacks.",

We design and build a base station certificate (certifying the base station's public key and location) and a multi-factor authentication (making use of the certificate and the information transmitted in the online radio control communications) to secure the authenticity and message integrity of the base station control communications. We advance beyond the state-of-the-art research by introducing greater authentication factors (and analyzing their individual security properties and benefits), and by using blockchain to deliver the base station digital certificate offline (enabling greater key length or security strength and computational or networking efficiency). We design the certificate construction, delivery, and the multi-factor authentication use on the user equipment. The user verification involves multiple factors verified through the ledger database, the location sensing (GPS in our implementation), and the cryptographic signature verification of the cellular control communication (SIB1 broadcasting). We analyze our scheme's security, performance, and the fit to the existing standardized networking protocols. Our work involves the implementation of building on X.509 certificate (adapted), smart contract-based blockchain, 5G-standardized RRC control communications, and software-defined radios. Our analyses show that our scheme effectively defends against more security threats and can enable stronger security, i.e., ECDSA with greater key lengths. Furthermore, our scheme enables computing and energy to be more than three times efficient than the previous research on the mobile user equipment.",

However, most of them classified attacks based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and they excluded attacks which compromise other security criteria such as accountability.

The objective is to observe consumers' energy usage pattern and exploit this information to assist the grid in designing incentives, energy management mechanisms, and real-time demand response protocols; so as help the grid achieving lower costs and improve energy supply stability. Further, by feeding the observed information back to the consumers instantaneously, it is also possible to promote energy efficient behavior among the users. To this end, this paper performs a literature survey on smart grid testbeds around the world, and presents the main accomplishments towards realizing a smart grid testbed at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The testbed is able to monitor, analyze and evaluate smart grid communication network design and control mechanisms, and test the suitability of various communications networks for both residential and commercial buildings. The testbeds are deployed within the SUTD student dormitories and the main university campus to monitor and record end-user energy consumption in real-time, which will enable us to design incentives, control algorithms and real-time demand response schemes. The testbed also provides an effective channel to evaluate the needs on communication networks to support various smart grid applications. In addition, our initial results demonstrate that our testbed can provide an effective platform to identify energy wastage, and prompt the needs of a secure communications channel as the energy usage pattern can provide privacy related information on individual user.",

RETINA tackles the inherent security and infrastructure challenges in smart grids by establishing a trust-based security layer and facilitating energy transactions through blockchain technology. Our proposed solution integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the Web of Trust (WoT) concepts, promoting decentralized communication channels and robust key management. We further introduce a smart contract-based energy trading mechanism that factors in trust, distance, and energy type (green or non-green) in cost calculation. The utility and robustness of RETINA have been validated in a virtualized testbed environment with 500 nodes, demonstrating superior performance in terms of scalability and resilience compared to the existing WoT scheme. Furthermore, RETINA successfully enables a secure and efficient energy trading scheme, promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Future enhancements will include application to a realistic smart grid deployment and the integration of additional functionalities. This groundbreaking solution has the potential to revolutionize the smart grid ecosystem, addressing its current limitations and propelling the industry towards a future of advanced and secure energy exchange.",

      "abstract": "The electricity production and distribution is facing two major changes. First, the production is shifting from classical energy sources such as coal and nuclear power towards renewable resources such as solar and wind. Secondly, the consumption in the low voltage grid is expected to grow significantly due to expected introduction of electrical vehicles. The first step towards more efficient operational capabilities is to introduce an observability of the distribution system and allow for leveraging the flexibility of end connection points with manageable consumption, generation and storage capabilities. Thanks to the advanced measurement devices, management framework, and secure communication infrastructure developed in the FP7 SUNSEED project, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) now has full observability of the energy flows at the medium/low voltage grid. Furthermore, the prosumers are able to participate pro-actively and coordinate with the DSO and other stakeholders in the grid. The monitoring and management functionalities have strong requirements to the communication latency, reliability and security. This paper presents novel solutions and analyses of these aspects for the SUNSEED scenario, where the smart grid ICT solutions are provided through shared cellular LTE networks.",

      "abstract": "Previous research employing a conceptual approach with a digital twin has demonstrated that (noise-based) dynamic watermarking is incapable of providing unconditional security in smart electrical grid systems. However, the implementation of digital twins can be prohibitively costly or infeasible due to limited available data on critical infrastructure. In this study, we first analyze the spectral properties of dynamic watermarking and its associated protocol. Subsequently, we present a straightforward attack inspired by the digital twin method, which extracts and utilizes the grid noises and completely breaches the security of dynamic watermarking without requiring knowledge of the private watermarking signal. The attacker can fully expose the grid while evading detection by the controller. Our findings indicate that in the absence of secure and authenticated communications, dynamic watermarking offers neither conditional nor unconditional security. Conversely, when communication lines, sensors, and communicators are equipped with tamper-resistant and secure/authenticated links, dynamic watermarking becomes redundant for grid security.",
