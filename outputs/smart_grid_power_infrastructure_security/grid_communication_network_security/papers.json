      "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the Kirchhoff-Law-Johnson-Noise (KLJN) as an approach to securing satellite communications. KLJN has the potential to revolutionize satellite communication security through its combination of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and resilience with unconditional security. Unlike quantum key distribution (QKD), which requires complex, fragile, and expensive infrastructure like photon detectors and dedicated optical links, KLJN operates using standard electronic components and wires, significantly reducing implementation costs and logistical hurdles. KLJN's security, grounded in the fundamental laws of classical physics, is impervious to environmental and radiation-induced noise, making it highly reliable in the harsh conditions of satellite communications. This robustness, coupled with its ability to integrate seamlessly with existing infrastructure, positions KLJN as a revolutionary alternative to quantum solutions for ensuring secure, resilient satellite communications. The authors explore the value of achieving unconditionally secure communications in strategic ground-to-satellite networks which address vulnerabilities posed by advanced computational threats, including quantum computing. Our team has examined two leading approaches to unconditional security - the KLJN scheme and QKD - and analyzed the potential use of each for space systems. While QKD leverages quantum mechanics for security, it faces challenges related to cost, complexity, and environmental sensitivity. In contrast, the KLJN scheme utilizes classical physics principles to provide a simpler, more cost-effective, and resilient alternative, particularly for ground-based systems. The study concludes that KLJN offers significant advantages in simplicity, cost-efficiency, and robustness, making it a practical choice for many secure communication applications.",

      "abstract": "Current cellular networking remains vulnerable to malicious fake base stations due to the lack of base station authentication mechanism or even a key to enable authentication. We design and build a base station certificate (certifying the base station's public key and location) and a multi-factor authentication (making use of the certificate and the information transmitted in the online radio control communications) to secure the authenticity and message integrity of the base station control communications. We advance beyond the state-of-the-art research by introducing greater authentication factors (and analyzing their individual security properties and benefits), and by using blockchain to deliver the base station digital certificate offline (enabling greater key length or security strength and computational or networking efficiency). We design the certificate construction, delivery, and the multi-factor authentication use on the user equipment. The user verification involves multiple factors verified through the ledger database, the location sensing (GPS in our implementation), and the cryptographic signature verification of the cellular control communication (SIB1 broadcasting). We analyze our scheme's security, performance, and the fit to the existing standardized networking protocols. Our work involves the implementation of building on X.509 certificate (adapted), smart contract-based blockchain, 5G-standardized RRC control communications, and software-defined radios. Our analyses show that our scheme effectively defends against more security threats and can enable stronger security, i.e., ECDSA with greater key lengths. Furthermore, our scheme enables computing and energy to be more than three times efficient than the previous research on the mobile user equipment.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-physical system (CPS) security for the smart grid enables secure communication for the SCADA and wide-area measurement system data. Power utilities world-wide use various SCADA protocols, namely DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850, for the data exchanges across substation field devices, remote terminal units (RTUs), and control center applications. Adversaries may exploit compromised SCADA protocols for the reconnaissance, data exfiltration, vulnerability assessment, and injection of stealthy cyberattacks to affect power system operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to generate robust rule sets. We integrate the rule sets into an intrusion detection system (IDS), which continuously monitors the DNP3 data traffic at a substation network and detects intrusions and anomalies in real-time. To enable CPS-aware wide-area situational awareness, we integrated the methodology into an open-source distributed-IDS (D-IDS) framework. The D-IDS facilitates central monitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed substations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different types of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are generated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules in different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules, and the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber Lab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models. After successful testing and evaluation, knowledge and implementation are transferred to field deployment.",

However, the implementation of digital twins can be prohibitively costly or infeasible due to limited available data on critical infrastructure. In this study, we first analyze the spectral properties of dynamic watermarking and its associated protocol. Subsequently, we present a straightforward attack inspired by the digital twin method, which extracts and utilizes the grid noises and completely breaches the security of dynamic watermarking without requiring knowledge of the private watermarking signal. The attacker can fully expose the grid while evading detection by the controller. Our findings indicate that in the absence of secure and authenticated communications, dynamic watermarking offers neither conditional nor unconditional security. Conversely, when communication lines, sensors, and communicators are equipped with tamper-resistant and secure/authenticated links, dynamic watermarking becomes redundant for grid security.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, critical infrastructure and power grids have experienced a series of cyber-attacks, leading to temporary, widespread blackouts of considerable magnitude. Since most substations are unmanned and have limited physical security protection, cyber breaches into power grid substations present a risk. Nowadays, software-defined network (SDN), a popular virtual network technology based on the OpenFlow protocol is being widely used in the substation automation system. However, the susceptibility of SDN architecture to cyber-attacks has exhibited a notable increase in recent years, as indicated by research findings. This suggests a growing concern regarding the potential for cybersecurity breaches within the SDN framework. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)-integrated SDN architecture for detecting and preventing the injection of malicious IEC 61850-based generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) messages in a digital substation. Additionally, this program locates the fault's location and, as a form of mitigation, disables a certain port. Furthermore, implementation examples are demonstrated and verified using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed that mimics the functioning of a digital substation.",

      "abstract": "Security has become a main concern for the smart grid to move from research and development to industry. The concept of security has usually referred to resistance to threats by an active or passive attacker. However, since smart meters (SMs) are often placed in unprotected areas, physical security has become one of the important security goals in the smart grid. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) have been largely utilized for ensuring physical security in recent years, though their reliability has remained a major problem to be practically used in cryptographic applications. Although fuzzy extractors have been considered as a solution to solve the reliability problem of PUFs, they put a considerable computational cost to the resource-constrained SMs. To that end, we first propose an on-chip-error-correcting (OCEC) PUF that efficiently generates stable digits for the authentication process. Afterward, we introduce a lightweight authentication protocol between the SMs and neighborhood gateway (NG) based on the proposed PUF. The provable security analysis shows that not only the proposed protocol can stand secure in the Canetti-Krawczyk (CK) adversary model but also provides additional security features. Also, the performance evaluation demonstrates the significant improvement of the proposed scheme in comparison with the state-of-the-art.",

      "abstract": "Smart grids are replacing conventional power grids due to rising electricity use, failing infrastructure, and reliability problems. Two-way communication, demand-side administration, and real-time pricing make smart grids (SGs) dependent on its communication system. Manual network administration slows down SG communication. SG networks additionally utilize hardware and software from several vendors, allowing devices to communicate. Software-defined SGs (SD-SG) use software-defined networking (SDN) to monitor and regulate SG global communication networks to address these concerns. SDN separates the data plane (routers and switches) from the control plane (routing logic) and centralizes control into the SDN controller. This helps network operators manage visibility, control, and security. These benefits have made SDN popular in SG architectural and security studies. But because SD-SGs are vulnerable to cyberattacks, there are concerns about the security of these SD-SG networks. Cybercriminals can attack software-defined communication networks, affecting the power grid. Unauthorized access can be used to intercept messages and introduce false data into system measurements, flood communication channels with fraudulent data packets, or target controllers, a potential single point of failure, to cripple SDN networks. Current research reflects this paradigm as defense and security against such attacks have developed and evolved. There is a need for a current study that provides a more detailed analysis and description of SD-SG network security dangers and countermeasures, as well as future research needs and developing threats for the sector. To fill this void, this survey is presented.",

In order to strengthen resistance to cyber-attacks, this study introduces a test bed for cyber-physical systems that operate in real-time. To investigate the network vulnerabilities of smart power grids, Modbus protocol has been examined combining a real-time power system simulator with a communication system simulator and the effects of the system presented and analyzed. The goal is to detect the vulnerability in Modbus protocol and perform the Man-in-the-middle attack with its impact on the system. This proposed testbed can be evaluated as a research model for vulnerability assessment as well as a tool for evaluating cyber-attacks and enquire into any detection mechanism for safeguarding and defending smart grid systems from a variety of cyberattacks. We present here the preliminary findings on using the testbed to identify a particular MiTM attack and the effects on system performance.

Nonetheless, the additional attack surface of information infrastructure has been brought about by the widespread adoption of ubiquitous connectivity in 5G, to which the typical information security system in the smart grid cannot respond promptly. Therefore, guaranteeing the Privacy and Security of a network in a threatening, ever-changing environment requires groundbreaking architectures that go well beyond the limitations of traditional, static security measures.

      "abstract": "The problem of data security in IEEE 802.15.4 systems on Pololu Wixel devices is solved, examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and decryption of different devices on the same platform are given. The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Possible areas of development for this work are related to research on improving encryption algorithms (increasing key length, using asymmetric ciphers, etc.), comparing their performance, and implementing a complete data exchange protocol. During the work there were problems in the implementation of encryption algorithms on low-power processors. During the work, a number of issues were resolved regarding type reduction, addressing, memory space, buffer overflow, and more. Issues resolved with reconciliation of receiver and transmitter operation. Examples of hardware and software implementation of encryption and decryption of different devices based on Pololu Wixel are given in the paper. The basic task of building a secure communication channel by encrypting data in the channel was solved and firmware and application software were obtained to fully validate the devices. In addition, this work has great application potential, since the implementation of encryption in existing systems will have a small impact on implementation and will not affect the project budget, but will dramatically improve the security of data transmission in these networks. The proposed approaches can be used in the development, implementation and operation of wireless enterprise, industrial, and personal systems. Continuing this work may be to test the performance of other protocols on this and similar hardware for systems that may be embedded in short-range wireless communication projects of short-range standards.",

      "abstract": "Internet users increasingly rely on commercial virtual private network (VPN) services to protect their security and privacy. The VPN services route the client's traffic over an encrypted tunnel to a VPN gateway in the cloud. Thus, they hide the client's real IP address from online services, and they also shield the user's connections from perceived threats in the access networks. In this paper, we study the security of such commercial VPN services. The focus is on how the client applications set up VPN tunnels, and how the service providers instruct users to configure generic client software. We analyze common VPN protocols and implementations on Windows, macOS and Ubuntu. We find that the VPN clients have various configuration flaws, which an attacker can exploit to strip off traffic encryption or to bypass authentication of the VPN gateway. In some cases, the attacker can also steal the VPN user's username and password. We suggest ways to mitigate each of the discovered vulnerabilities.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid uses the power of information technology to intelligently deliver energy to customers by using a two-way communication, and wisely meet the environmental requirements by facilitating the integration of green technologies. Although smart grid addresses several problems of the traditional grid, it faces a number of security challenges. Because communication has been incorporated into the electrical power with its inherent weaknesses, it has exposed the system to numerous risks. Several research papers have discussed these problems. However, most of them classified attacks based on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and they excluded attacks which compromise other security criteria such as accountability. In addition, the existed security countermeasures focus on countering some specific attacks or protecting some specific components, but there is no global approach which combines these solutions to secure the entire system. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive overview of the relevant published works. First, we review the security requirements. Then, we investigate in depth a number of important cyber-attacks in smart grid to diagnose the potential vulnerabilities along with their impact. In addition, we proposed a cyber security strategy as a solution to address breaches, counter attacks, and deploy appropriate countermeasures. Finally, we provide some future research directions.",

      "abstract": "The current power grid is no longer a feasible solution due to ever-increasing user demand of electricity, old infrastructure, and reliability issues and thus require transformation to a better grid a.k.a., smart grid (SG). The key features that distinguish SG from the conventional electrical power grid are its capability to perform two-way communication, demand side management, and real time pricing. Despite all these advantages that SG will bring, there are certain issues which are specific to SG communication system. For instance, network management of current SG systems is complex, time consuming, and done manually. Moreover, SG communication (SGC) system is built on different vendor specific devices and protocols. Therefore, the current SG systems are not protocol independent, thus leading to interoperability issue. Software defined network (SDN) has been proposed to monitor and manage the communication networks globally. This article serves as a comprehensive survey on SDN-based SGC. In this article, we first discuss taxonomy of advantages of SDNbased SGC.We then discuss SDN-based SGC architectures, along with case studies. Our article provides an in-depth discussion on routing schemes for SDN-based SGC. We also provide detailed survey of security and privacy schemes applied to SDN-based SGC. We furthermore present challenges, open issues, and future research directions related to SDN-based SGC.",

      "abstract": "The electricity production and distribution is facing two major changes. First, the production is shifting from classical energy sources such as coal and nuclear power towards renewable resources such as solar and wind. Secondly, the consumption in the low voltage grid is expected to grow significantly due to expected introduction of electrical vehicles. The first step towards more efficient operational capabilities is to introduce an observability of the distribution system and allow for leveraging the flexibility of end connection points with manageable consumption, generation and storage capabilities. Thanks to the advanced measurement devices, management framework, and secure communication infrastructure developed in the FP7 SUNSEED project, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) now has full observability of the energy flows at the medium/low voltage grid. Furthermore, the prosumers are able to participate pro-actively and coordinate with the DSO and other stakeholders in the grid. The monitoring and management functionalities have strong requirements to the communication latency, reliability and security. This paper presents novel solutions and analyses of these aspects for the SUNSEED scenario, where the smart grid ICT solutions are provided through shared cellular LTE networks.",

Such cyber-physical attacks can have detrimental effects on the operation of the grid as exemplified by the recent attack which caused a blackout of the Ukranian power grid. Thus, to properly secure the smart grid, it is of utmost importance to: a) understand its underlying vulnerabilities and associated threats, b) quantify their effects, and c) devise appropriate security solutions. In this paper, the key threats targeting the smart grid are first exposed while assessing their effects on the operation and stability of the grid. Then, the challenges involved in understanding these attacks and devising defense strategies against them are identified. Potential solution approaches that can help mitigate these threats are then discussed. Last, a number of mathematical tools that can help in analyzing and implementing security solutions are introduced. As such, this paper will provide the first comprehensive overview on smart grid security.",

      "abstract": "Successful deployment of smart grids necessitates experimental validities of their state-of-the-art designs in two-way communications, real-time demand response and monitoring of consumers' energy usage behavior. The objective is to observe consumers' energy usage pattern and exploit this information to assist the grid in designing incentives, energy management mechanisms, and real-time demand response protocols; so as help the grid achieving lower costs and improve energy supply stability. Further, by feeding the observed information back to the consumers instantaneously, it is also possible to promote energy efficient behavior among the users. To this end, this paper performs a literature survey on smart grid testbeds around the world, and presents the main accomplishments towards realizing a smart grid testbed at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD). The testbed is able to monitor, analyze and evaluate smart grid communication network design and control mechanisms, and test the suitability of various communications networks for both residential and commercial buildings. The testbeds are deployed within the SUTD student dormitories and the main university campus to monitor and record end-user energy consumption in real-time, which will enable us to design incentives, control algorithms and real-time demand response schemes. The testbed also provides an effective channel to evaluate the needs on communication networks to support various smart grid applications. In addition, our initial results demonstrate that our testbed can provide an effective platform to identify energy wastage, and prompt the needs of a secure communications channel as the energy usage pattern can provide privacy related information on individual user.",

We establish the classification of core Grid protocols into i) Grid network communication and Grid data transfer protocols, ii) Grid information security protocols, iii) Grid resource information protocols, iv) Grid management protocols, and v) Grid interface protocols, depending upon the kind of activities handled by these protocols. All the classified protocols are also organized into layers of the Hourglass model of Grid architecture to understand dependency among these protocols. We also present the characteristics of each protocol. For better understanding of these protocols, we also discuss applied protocols as examples from either Globus toolkit or other popular Grid middleware projects. We believe that our classification and characterization of Grid protocols will enable better understanding of core Grid protocols and will motivate further research in the area of Global Grid Computing.",

      "abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have emerged as a promising concept to meet the challenges in next-generation networks such as providing flexible, adaptive, and reconfigurable architecture while offering cost-effective solutions to the service providers. Unlike traditional Wi-Fi networks, with each access point (AP) connected to the wired network, in WMNs only a subset of the APs are required to be connected to the wired network. The APs that are connected to the wired network are called the Internet gateways (IGWs), while the APs that do not have wired connections are called the mesh routers (MRs). The MRs are connected to the IGWs using multi-hop communication. The IGWs provide access to conventional clients and interconnect ad hoc, sensor, cellular, and other networks to the Internet. However, most of the existing routing protocols for WMNs are extensions of protocols originally designed for mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and thus they perform sub-optimally. Moreover, most routing protocols for WMNs are designed without security issues in mind, where the nodes are all assumed to be honest. In practical deployment scenarios, this assumption does not hold. This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of security issues in WMNs and then particularly focuses on secure routing in these networks. First, it identifies security vulnerabilities in the medium access control (MAC) and the network layers. Various possibilities of compromising data confidentiality, data integrity, replay attacks and offline cryptanalysis are also discussed. Then various types of attacks in the MAC and the network layers are discussed. After enumerating the various types of attacks on the MAC and the network layer, the chapter briefly discusses on some of the preventive mechanisms for these attacks.",
