      "abstract": "The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into power grids via Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) system technology is increasing day by day, but these phenomena present both advantages and disadvantages. V2G can increase grid reliability by providing distributed energy storage and ancillary services. However, on the other hand, it has a scope that encompasses the cyber-physical attack surface of the national power grid, introducing new vulnerabilities in monitoring and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. This paper investigates the maliciousness caused by Autonomous Vehicle to Grid (AV2G) communication infrastructures and assesses their impacts on SCADA system reliability. This paper presents a quantitative reliability assessment using Bayesian attack graph combined with probabilistic capacity outage modeling based on IEEE RTS-79 system data. This work presents how AV2G-based attacks degrade system performance by using Monte Carlo simulations method, highlighting the need for cybersecurity-hardening strategies in smart grid design.",

      "abstract": "Smart Grids are evolving as the next generation power systems that involve changes in the traditional ways of generation, transmission and distribution of power. Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is one of the key components in smart grids. An AMI comprises of systems and networks, that collects and analyzes data received from smart meters. In addition, AMI also provides intelligent management of various power-related applications and services based on the data collected from smart meters. Thus, AMI plays a significant role in the smooth functioning of smart grids.   AMI is a privileged target for security attacks as it is made up of systems that are highly vulnerable to such attacks. Providing security to AMI is necessary as adversaries can cause potential damage against infrastructures and privacy in smart grid. One of the most effective and challenging topic's identified, is the Key Management System (KMS), for sustaining the security concerns in AMI. Therefore, KMS seeks to be a promising research area for future development of AMI. This survey work highlights the key security issues of advanced metering infrastructures and focuses on how key management techniques can be utilized for safeguarding AMI. First of all, we explore the main features of advanced metering infrastructures and identify the relationship between smart grid and AMI. Then, we introduce the security issues and challenges of AMI. We also provide a classification of the existing works in literature that deal with secure key management system in AMI. Finally, we identify possible future research directions of KMS in AMI.",

      "abstract": "Digitalization of power grids have made them increasingly susceptible to cyber-attacks in the past decade. Iterative cybersecurity testing is indispensable to counter emerging attack vectors and to ensure dependability of critical infrastructure. Furthermore, these can be used to evaluate cybersecurity configuration, effectiveness of the cybersecurity measures against various attack vectors, as well as to train smart grid cybersecurity experts defending the system. Enabling extensive experiments narrows the gap between academic research and production environment. A high-fidelity cyber range is vital as it is often infeasible to conduct such experiments and training using production environment. However, the design and implementation of cyber range requires extensive domain knowledge of physical and cyber aspect of the infrastructure. Furthermore, costs incurred for setup and maintenance of cyber range are significant. Moreover, most existing smart grid cyber ranges are designed as a one-off, proprietary system, and are limited in terms of configurability, accessibility, portability, and reproducibility. To address these challenges, an automated Smart grid Cyber Range generation framework is presented in this paper. Initially a human-/machine-friendly, XML-based modeling language called Smart Grid Modeling Language was defined, which incorporates IEC 61850 System Configuration Language files. Subsequently, a toolchain to parse SG-ML model files and automatically instantiate a functional smart grid cyber range was developed. The developed SG-ML models can be easily shared and/or modified to reproduce or customize for any cyber range. The application of Auto-SGCR is demonstrated through case studies with large-scale substation models. The toolchain along with example SG-ML models have been open-sourced.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, critical infrastructure and power grids have experienced a series of cyber-attacks, leading to temporary, widespread blackouts of considerable magnitude. Since most substations are unmanned and have limited physical security protection, cyber breaches into power grid substations present a risk. Nowadays, software-defined network (SDN), a popular virtual network technology based on the OpenFlow protocol is being widely used in the substation automation system. However, the susceptibility of SDN architecture to cyber-attacks has exhibited a notable increase in recent years, as indicated by research findings. This suggests a growing concern regarding the potential for cybersecurity breaches within the SDN framework. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)-integrated SDN architecture for detecting and preventing the injection of malicious IEC 61850-based generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) messages in a digital substation. Additionally, this program locates the fault's location and, as a form of mitigation, disables a certain port. Furthermore, implementation examples are demonstrated and verified using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed that mimics the functioning of a digital substation.",

      "abstract": "As a national critical infrastructure, the smart grid has attracted widespread attention for its cybersecurity issues. The development towards an intelligent, digital, and Internet-connected smart grid has attracted external adversaries for malicious activities. It is necessary to enhance its cybersecurity by both improving the existing defense approaches and introducing novel developed technologies to the smart grid context. As an emerging technology, digital twin (DT) is considered as an enabler for enhanced security. However, the practical implementation is quite challenging. This is due to the knowledge barriers among smart grid designers, security experts, and DT developers. Each single domain is a complicated system covering various components and technologies. As a result, works are needed to sort out relevant contents so that DT can be better embedded in the security architecture design of smart grid.   In order to meet this demand, our paper covers the above three domains, i.e., smart grid, cybersecurity, and DT. Specifically, the paper i) introduces the background of the smart grid; ii) reviews external cyber attacks from attack incidents and attack methods; iii) introduces critical defense approaches in industrial cyber systems, which include device identification, vulnerability discovery, intrusion detection systems (IDSs), honeypots, attribution, and threat intelligence (TI); iv) reviews the relevant content of DT, including its basic concepts, applications in the smart grid, and how DT enhances the security. In the end, the paper puts forward our security considerations on the future development of DT-based smart grid. The survey is expected to help developers break knowledge barriers among smart grid, cybersecurity, and DT, and provide guidelines for future security design of DT-based smart grid.",

      "abstract": "Cyber-physical system (CPS) security for the smart grid enables secure communication for the SCADA and wide-area measurement system data. Power utilities world-wide use various SCADA protocols, namely DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850, for the data exchanges across substation field devices, remote terminal units (RTUs), and control center applications. Adversaries may exploit compromised SCADA protocols for the reconnaissance, data exfiltration, vulnerability assessment, and injection of stealthy cyberattacks to affect power system operation. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm to generate robust rule sets. We integrate the rule sets into an intrusion detection system (IDS), which continuously monitors the DNP3 data traffic at a substation network and detects intrusions and anomalies in real-time. To enable CPS-aware wide-area situational awareness, we integrated the methodology into an open-source distributed-IDS (D-IDS) framework. The D-IDS facilitates central monitoring of the detected anomalies from the geographically distributed substations and to the control center. The proposed algorithm provides an optimal solution to detect network intrusions and abnormal behavior. Different types of IDS rules based on packet payload, packet flow, and time threshold are generated. Further, IDS testing and evaluation is performed with a set of rules in different sequences. The detection time is measured for different IDS rules, and the results are plotted. All the experiments are conducted at Power Cyber Lab, Iowa State University, for multiple power grid models. After successful testing and evaluation, knowledge and implementation are transferred to field deployment.",

In this paper, we analyze the communication infrastructure of power grids to derive resulting fundamental challenges of power grids with respect to cybersecurity. Based on these challenges, we identify a broad set of resulting attack vectors and attack scenarios that threaten the security of power grids.

Therefore, to protect this critical power system infrastructure and to ensure a reliable and an uninterrupted power supply to the end users, smart grid security issues must be addressed with high priority. In a smart grid environment, electric power infrastructure is modernized by incorporating the current and future requirements and advanced functionalities to its consumers. To make the smart grid happen, cyber system is integrated with the physical power system. Although adoption of cyber system has made the grid more energy efficient and modernized, it has introduced cyber-attack issues which are critical for national infrastructure security and customer satisfaction. Due to the cyber-attack, power grid may face operational failures and loss of synchronization. This operational failure may damage critical power system components which may interrupt the power supply and make the system unstable resulting high financial penalties.

In order to evaluate the impact of potential cyber attacks, to assess deployability and effectiveness of cybersecurity measures, and to enable hands-on exercise and training of personals, an interactive, virtual environment that emulates the behaviour of a smart grid system, namely smart grid cyber range, has been demanded by industry players as well as academia. A smart grid cyber range is typically implemented as a combination of cyber system emulation, which allows interactivity, and physical system (i.e., power grid) simulation that are tightly coupled for consistent cyber and physical behaviours. However, its design and implementation require intensive expertise and efforts in cyber and physical aspects of smart power systems as well as software/system engineering. While many industry players, including power grid operators, device vendors, research and education sectors are interested, availability of the smart grid cyber range is limited to a small number of research labs. To address this challenge, we have developed a framework for modelling a smart grid cyber range using an XML-based language, called SG-ML, and for \"compiling\" the model into an operational cyber range with minimal engineering efforts. The modelling language includes standardized schema from IEC 61850 and IEC 61131, which allows industry players to utilize their existing configurations.

The SCS framework improves the physical network's behavior (i.e., leveraging commercial SDN capabilities) by incorporating an adaptive port controller (APC) module for dynamic port management and an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and counteract malicious IEC-61850-based sampled value (SV) and generic object-oriented system event (GOOSE) messages within the substation's communication network. The framework's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive simulations and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed, demonstrating its ability to sustain substation operations during cyber-attacks and significantly improve the overall resilience of the power grid.",

      "abstract": "Smart Grid systems not only transport electric energy but also information which will be active part of the electricity supply system. This has led to the introduction of intelligent components on all layers of the electrical grid in power generation, transmission, distribution and consumption units. For electric distribution systems, Information from Smart Meters can be utilized to monitor and control the state of the grid. Hence, it is indeed inherent that data from Smart Meters should be collected in a resilient, reliable, secure and timely manner fulfilling all the communication requirements and standards. This paper presents a proposal for smart data collection mechanisms to monitor electrical grids with adaptive smart metering infrastructures. A general overview of a platform is given for testing, evaluating and implementing mechanisms to adapt Smart Meter data aggregation. Three main aspects of adaptiveness of the system are studied, adaptiveness to smart metering application needs, adaptiveness to changing communication network dynamics and adaptiveness to security attacks. Execution of tests will be conducted in real field experimental set-up and in an advanced hardware in the loop test-bed with power and communication co-simulation for validation purposes.",

Co-simulations can be used to investigate such effects, but require precise modeling of the energy, communication, and information domain within an integrated smart grid infrastructure model. Given the complexity and lack of detailed publicly available communication network models for smart grid scenarios, there is a need for an automated and systematic approach to creating such coupled models. In this paper, we present an approach to automatically generate smart grid infrastructure models based on an arbitrary electrical distribution grid model using a generic architectural template. We demonstrate the applicability and unique features of our approach alongside examples concerning network planning, co-simulation setup, and specification of domain-specific intrusion detection systems.",

With the emergence of the smart grid, SCADA systems are increasingly required to be connected to more open systems and security becomes crucial. However, many of these SCADA systems have been deployed for decades and were initially not designed with security in mind. In particular, the field devices in these systems are vulnerable to false command injection from an intruding or compromised device. But implementing cryptographic defence on these old-generation devices is challenging due to their computation constraints. As a key requirement, solutions to protect legacy SCADA systems have to be an add-on. This paper discusses two add-on defence strategies for legacy SCADA systems -- the data diode and the detect-and-respond approach -- and compares their security guarantees and applicable scenarios. A generic architectural framework is also proposed to implement the detect-and-respond strategy, with an instantiation to demonstrate its practicality.",

These flows support the transfer of electricity and information, in order to support automation actions in the context of the energy delivery network. Insofar, many smart grid implementations and implementation proposals have emerged, with varying degrees of feature delivery and sophistication. While smart grids offer many advantages, their distributed nature and information flow streams between energy producers and consumers enable the launching of a number of attacks against the smart grid infrastructure, where the related consequences may range from economic loss to complete failure of the smart grid.

Denial-of-Service (DoS) is one such threat. At the same time, the smart grid has particular characteristics (e.g. minimal delay tolerance), which can influence the nature of threats and so require special consideration. In this paper, we identify a set of possible smart grid-specific DoS scenarios based on current research, and analyse them in the context of the grid components they target. Based on this, we propose a novel target-based classification scheme and further characterise each scenario by qualitatively exploring it in the context of the underlying grid infrastructure. This culminates in a smart grid-centric analysis of the threat to reveal the nature of DoS in this environment.",

      "abstract": "Cyberattacks on smart inverters and distributed PV are becoming an imminent threat, because of the recent well-documented vulnerabilities and attack incidents. Particularly, the long lifespan of inverter devices, users' oblivion of cybersecurity compliance, and the lack of cyber regulatory frameworks exacerbate the prospect of cyberattacks on smart inverters. As a result, this raises a question -- \"do cyberattacks on smart inverters, if orchestrated on a large scale, pose a genuine threat of wide-scale instability to the power grid and energy market\"? This paper provides a realistic assessment on the plausibility and impacts of wide-scale power instability caused by cyberattacks on smart inverters. We conduct an in-depth study based on the electricity market data of Australia and the knowledge of practical contingency mechanisms. Our key findings reveal: (1) Despite the possibility of disruption to the grid by cyberattacks on smart inverters, the impact is only significant under careful planning and orchestration. (2) While the grid can assure certain power system security to survive inadvertent contingency events, it is insufficient to defend against savvy attackers who can orchestrate attacks in an adversarial manner. Our data analysis of Australia's electricity grid also reveals that a relatively low percentage of distributed PV would be sufficient to launch an impactful concerted attack on the grid. Our study casts insights on robust strategies for defending the grid in the presence of cyberattacks for places with high penetration of distributed PV.",

      "abstract": "Many nations are promoting the green transition in the energy sector to attain neutral carbon emissions by 2050. Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.",

By adding advanced data analytics, these systems can better manage the complexities of renewable energy integration, demand response, and predictive maintenance. Machine learning algorithms analyze vast amounts of data from smart meters, sensors, and other grid components to optimize energy distribution, forecast demand, and detect irregularities that could indicate potential failures. This enables more precise load balancing, reduces operational costs, and enhances the resilience of the grid against disturbances. Furthermore, the use of predictive models helps in anticipating equipment failures, thereby improving the reliability of the energy supply.

However, the deployment of these technologies also raises challenges related to data privacy, security, and the need for robust infrastructure. Addressing these issues in this research authors will focus on realizing the full potential of smart grids, ensuring they meet the growing energy demands while maintaining a focus on sustainability and efficiency using Machine Learning techniques. Furthermore, this research will help determine the smart grid's essentiality with the aid of Machine Learning. Multiple ML algorithms have been integrated along with their pros and cons.

      "abstract": "The Smart Grid (SG) is a cornerstone of modern society, providing the energy required to sustain billions of lives and thousands of industries. Unfortunately, as one of the most critical infrastructures of our World, the SG is an attractive target for attackers. The problem is aggravated by the increasing adoption of digitalisation, which further increases the SG's exposure to cyberthreats. Successful exploitation of such exposure leads to entire countries being paralysed, which is an unacceptable -- but ultimately inescapable -- risk.   This paper aims to mitigate this risk by elucidating the perspective of real practitioners on the cybersecurity of the SG. We interviewed 18 entities, operating in diverse countries in Europe and covering all domains of the SG -- from energy generation, to its delivery. Our analysis highlights a stark contrast between (a)research and practice, but also between (b) public and private entities. For instance: some threats appear to be much less dangerous than what is claimed in related papers; some technological paradigms have dubious utility for practitioners, but are actively promoted by literature; finally, practitioners may either under- or over-estimate their own cybersecurity capabilities. We derive four takeaways that enable future endeavours to improve the overall cybersecurity in the SG. We conjecture that most of the problems are due to an improper communication between researchers, practitioners and regulatory bodies -- which, despite sharing a common goal, tend to neglect the viewpoint of the other `spheres'.",

Our proposed solution integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the Web of Trust (WoT) concepts, promoting decentralized communication channels and robust key management. We further introduce a smart contract-based energy trading mechanism that factors in trust, distance, and energy type (green or non-green) in cost calculation. The utility and robustness of RETINA have been validated in a virtualized testbed environment with 500 nodes, demonstrating superior performance in terms of scalability and resilience compared to the existing WoT scheme. Furthermore, RETINA successfully enables a secure and efficient energy trading scheme, promoting the use of renewable energy sources.

Intrusion tolerance proves a promising security approach against malicious attacks and contributes to enhance the resilience and security of the key components of smart grid, mainly SCADA and control centers. Hence, an intrusion tolerant system architecture for smart grid control centers is proposed in this paper. The proposed architecture consists of several modules namely, replication & diversity, compromised/faulty replica detector, reconfiuration, auditing and proxy. Some of distinctive features of the proposed ITS are diversity as well as the combined and fine-grained rejuvenation approach. The security of the proposed architecture is evaluated with regard to availability and mean time to security failure as performance measures. The analysis is conducted using a Discrete Time Semi Markov Model and the acquired results show improvements compared to two established intrusion tolerant architectures. The viability of SLA as another performance metric is also investigated.",

      "abstract": "The smart grid concept has transformed the traditional power grid into a massive cyber-physical system that depends on advanced two-way communication infrastructure to integrate a myriad of different smart devices. While the introduction of the cyber component has made the grid much more flexible and efficient with so many smart devices, it also broadened the attack surface of the power grid. Particularly, compromised devices pose a great danger to the healthy operations of the smart-grid. For instance, the attackers can control the devices to change the behaviour of the grid and can impact the measurements. In this paper, to detect such misbehaving malicious smart grid devices, we propose a machine learning and convolution-based classification framework. Our framework specifically utilizes system and library call lists at the kernel level of the operating system on both resource-limited and resource-rich smart grid devices such as RTUs, PLCs, PMUs, and IEDs. Focusing on the types and other valuable features extracted from the system calls, the framework can successfully identify malicious smart-grid devices. In order to test the efficacy of the proposed framework, we built a representative testbed conforming to the IEC-61850 protocol suite and evaluated its performance with different system calls. The proposed framework in different evaluation scenarios yields very high accuracy (avg. 91%) which reveals that the framework is effective to overcome compromised smart grid devices problem.",

Recently, false data injection (FDI) has become one of the most critical cyberattacks, and appears to be a focal point of interest for both research and industry. To this end, this paper presents a comprehensive review in the recent advances of the FDI attacks, with particular emphasis on 1) adversarial models, 2) attack targets, and 3) impacts in the Smart Grid infrastructure. This review paper aims to provide a thorough understanding of the incumbent threats affecting the entire spectrum of the Smart Grid.

In conclusion, a range of technical limitations of existing false data attack research is identified, and a number of future research directions is recommended.",

In the present paper, we propose a two-level anomaly detection framework based on regression decision trees. The introduced detection approach leverages the regularity and predictability of energy consumption to build reference consumption patterns for the whole neighborhood and each household within it. Using a reference consumption pattern enables detecting power overloading cyberattacks regardless of the attacker's strategy as they cause a drastic change in the consumption pattern. The continuous two-level monitoring of energy consumption load allows efficient and early detection of cyberattacks. We carried out an extensive experiment on a real-world publicly available energy consumption dataset of 500 customers in Ireland. We extracted, from the raw data, the relevant attributes for training the energy consumption patterns. The evaluation shows that our approach achieves a high detection rate, a low false alarm rate, and superior performances compared to existing solutions.",

In this paper, we propose a secure compressed reading scheme to address this critical issue. We observe that our collected real-world meter data express strong temporal correlations, indicating they are sparse in certain domains. We adopt Compressed Sensing technique to exploit this sparsity and design an efficient meter data transmission scheme. Our scheme achieves substantial efficiency offered by compressed sensing, without the need to know beforehand in which domain the meter data are sparse. This is in contrast to traditional compressed-sensing based scheme where such sparse-domain information is required a priori. We then design specific dependable scheme to work with our compressed sensing based data transmission scheme to make our meter reading reliable and secure. We provide performance guarantee for the correctness, efficiency, and security of our proposed scheme. Through analysis and simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our schemes and compare their performance to prior arts.",

Moreover, the resource-constrained smart meters need to perform heavy asymmetric cryptography in these solutions, which is not applied to smart grid. In this paper, we present a practical and secure SGX-enabled smart grid system, named SecGrid. Our system leverage trusted hardware SGX to ensure that grid utilities can efficiently execute rich functionalities on customers' private data, while guaranteeing their privacy. With the designed security protocols, the SecGrid only require the smart meters to perform AES encryption. Security analysis shows that SecGrid can thwart various attacks from malicious adversaries.

      "abstract": "Previous research employing a conceptual approach with a digital twin has demonstrated that (noise-based) dynamic watermarking is incapable of providing unconditional security in smart electrical grid systems. However, the implementation of digital twins can be prohibitively costly or infeasible due to limited available data on critical infrastructure. In this study, we first analyze the spectral properties of dynamic watermarking and its associated protocol. Subsequently, we present a straightforward attack inspired by the digital twin method, which extracts and utilizes the grid noises and completely breaches the security of dynamic watermarking without requiring knowledge of the private watermarking signal. The attacker can fully expose the grid while evading detection by the controller. Our findings indicate that in the absence of secure and authenticated communications, dynamic watermarking offers neither conditional nor unconditional security. Conversely, when communication lines, sensors, and communicators are equipped with tamper-resistant and secure/authenticated links, dynamic watermarking becomes redundant for grid security.",

      "abstract": "Smart power grid enables intelligent automation at all levels of power system operation, from electricity generation at power plants to power usage at households. The key enabling factor of an efficient smart grid is its built-in information and communication technology (ICT) that monitors the real-time system operating state and makes control decisions accordingly. As an important building block of the ICT system, power system state estimation is of critical importance to maintain normal operation of the smart grid, which, however, is under mounting threat from potential cyber attacks. In this article, we introduce a graph-based framework for performing cyber-security analysis in power system state estimation. Compared to conventional arithmetic-based security analysis, the graphical characterization of state estimation security provides intuitive visualization of some complex problem structures and enables efficient graphical solution algorithms, which are useful for both defending and attacking the ICT system of smart grid. We also highlight several promising future research directions on graph-based security analysis and its applications in smart power grid.",
