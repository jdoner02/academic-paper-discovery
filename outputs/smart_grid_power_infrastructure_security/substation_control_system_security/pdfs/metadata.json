      "abstract": "In recent years, critical infrastructure and power grids have increasingly been targets of cyber-attacks, causing widespread and extended blackouts. Digital substations are particularly vulnerable to such cyber incursions, jeopardizing grid stability. This paper addresses these risks by proposing a cybersecurity framework that leverages software-defined networking (SDN) to bolster the resilience of substations based on the IEC-61850 standard. The research introduces a strategy involving smart cyber switching (SCS) for mitigation and concurrent intelligent electronic device (CIED) for restoration, ensuring ongoing operational integrity and cybersecurity within a substation. The SCS framework improves the physical network's behavior (i.e., leveraging commercial SDN capabilities) by incorporating an adaptive port controller (APC) module for dynamic port management and an intrusion detection system (IDS) to detect and counteract malicious IEC-61850-based sampled value (SV) and generic object-oriented system event (GOOSE) messages within the substation's communication network. The framework's effectiveness is validated through comprehensive simulations and a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed, demonstrating its ability to sustain substation operations during cyber-attacks and significantly improve the overall resilience of the power grid.",

      "abstract": "Growing cybersecurity risks in the power grid require that utilities implement a variety of security mechanism (SM) composed mostly of VPNs, firewalls, or other custom security components. While they provide some protection, they might contain software vulnerabilities which can lead to a cyber-attack. In this paper, the severity of a cyber-attack has been decreased by employing a diverse set of SM that reduce repetition of a single vulnerability. This paper focuses on the allocation of diverse SM and tries to increase the security of the cyber assets located within the electronic security perimeter(ESP) of a substation. We have used a graph-based coloring game in a distributed manner to allocate diverse SM for protecting the cyber assets. The vulnerability assessment for power grid network is also analyzed using this game theoretic method. An improved, diversified SMs for worst-case scenario has been demonstrated by reaching the Nash equilibrium of graph coloring game. As a case study, we analyze the IEEE-14 and IEEE-118 bus system, observe the different distributed coloring algorithm for allocating diverse SM and calculating the overall network criticality.",

      "abstract": "Power grids worldwide are increasingly victims of cyberattacks, where attackers can cause immense damage to critical infrastructure. The growing digitalization and networking in power grids combined with insufficient protection against cyberattacks further exacerbate this trend. Hence, security engineers and researchers must counter these new risks by continuously improving security measures. Data sets of real network traffic during cyberattacks play a decisive role in analyzing and understanding such attacks. Therefore, this paper presents PowerDuck, a publicly available security data set containing network traces of GOOSE communication in a physical substation testbed. The data set includes recordings of various scenarios with and without the presence of attacks. Furthermore, all network packets originating from the attacker are clearly labeled to facilitate their identification. We thus envision PowerDuck improving and complementing existing data sets of substations, which are often generated synthetically, thus enhancing the security of power grids.",

      "abstract": "The digital transformation of power systems is accelerating the adoption of IEC 61850 standard. However, its communication protocols, including Sampled Values (SV), lack built-in security features such as authentication and encryption, making them vulnerable to malicious packet injection. Such cyber attacks can delay fault clearance or trigger unintended circuit breaker operations. While most existing research focuses on detecting cyber attacks in digital substations, intrusion prevention systems have been disregarded because of the risk of potential communication network disruptions. This paper proposes a novel method using hybrid statistical-deep learning for the detection, prevention, and source localization of IEC 61850 SV injection attacks. The method uses exponentially modified Gaussian distributions to model communication network latency and long short-term memory and Elman recurrent neural network to detect anomalous variations in the estimated probability distributions. It effectively discards malicious SV frames with minimal processing overhead and latency, maintains robustness against communication network latency variation and time-synchronization issues, and guarantees a near-zero false positive rate in non-attack scenarios. Comprehensive validation is conducted on three testbeds involving industrial-grade devices, hardware-in-the-loop simulations, virtualized intelligent electronic devices and merging units, and high-fidelity emulated communication networks. Results demonstrate the method's suitability for practical deployment in IEC 61850-compliant digital substations.",

Attackers are more focused on attacking the supply chain of the DS, as they a comprise a multivendor environment. In this research work, we present the Substation Bill of Materials (Subs-BOM) schema, based on the CycloneDX specification, that is capable of modeling all the IEDs in a DS and their relationships from a cybersecurity perspective. The proposed Subs-BOM allows one to make informed decisions about cyber risks related to the supply chain, and enables managing multiple DS at the same time. This provides energy utilities with an accurate and complete inventory of the devices, the firmware they are running, and the services that are deployed into the DS. The Subs-BOM is generated using the Substation Configuration Description (SCD) file specified in the IEC 61850 standard as its main source of information.   We validated the Subs-BOM schema against the Dependency-Track software by OWASP. This validation proved that the schema is correctly recognized by CycloneDX-compatible tools. Moreover, the Dependency-Track software could track existing vulnerabilities in the IEDs represented by the Subs-BOM.",

      "abstract": "Electrical substations are becoming more prone to cyber-attacks due to increasing digitalization. Prevailing defense measures based on cyber rules are often inadequate to detect attacks that use legitimate-looking measurements. In this work, we design and implement a bad data detection solution for electrical substations called ResiGate, that effectively combines a physics-based approach and a machine-learning-based approach to provide substantial speed-up in high-throughput substation communication scenarios, while still maintaining high detection accuracy and confidence. While many existing physics-based schemes are designed for deployment in control centers (due to their high computational requirement), ResiGate is designed as a security appliance that can be deployed on low-cost industrial computers at the edge of the smart grid so that it can detect local substation-level attacks in a timely manner. A key challenge for this is to continuously run the computationally demanding physics-based analysis to monitor the measurement data frequently transmitted in a typical substation. To provide high throughput without sacrificing accuracy, ResiGate uses machine learning to effectively filter out most of the non-suspicious (normal) data and thereby reducing the overall computational load, allowing efficient performance even with a high volume of network traffic. We implement ResiGate on a low-cost industrial computer and our experiments confirm that ResiGate can detect attacks with zero error while sustaining a high throughput.",

However, the digitalization of substations, which involves the use of cyber system, inherently increases their vulnerability to cyberattacks. This paper proposes the detection of cyberattacks through an anomaly-based approach utilizing Machine Learning (ML) methods within central control systems of the power system network. Furthermore, when an anomaly is identified, mitigation and restoration strategies employing concurrent Intelligent Electronic Devices (CIEDs) are utilized to ensure robust substation automation system operations. The proposed ML model is trained using Sampled Value (SV) and Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) data from each substation within the entire transmission system. As a result, the trained ML models can classify cyberattacks and normal faults, while the use of CIEDs contributes to cyberattack mitigation, and substation restoration.",

In this paper, we address the critical challenge of detecting novel/zero-day attacks in digital substations that employ the IEC-61850 communication protocol. While many heuristic and machine learning (ML)-based methods have been proposed for attack detection in IEC-61850 digital substations, generalization to novel or zero-day attacks remains challenging. We propose an approach that leverages the in-context learning (ICL) capability of the transformer architecture, the fundamental building block of large language models. The ICL approach enables the model to detect zero-day attacks and learn from a few examples of that attack without explicit retraining. Our experiments on the IEC-61850 dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves more than $85\\%$ detection accuracy on zero-day attacks while the existing state-of-the-art baselines fail. This work paves the way for building more secure and resilient digital substations of the future.",

The International standardization, in the field of power transmission and distribution, improve technology influences. The rise of dedicated standards for SAS (Substation Automation Systems) communications, such as the leading International Electro-technical Commission standard IEC 61850, enforces modern technological trends in this field. Within this standard, a constraint of low ETE (End-to-End) latency should be respected, and time-critical status transmission must be achieved.

For defenders, it is critical to enumerate and identify all digital relays to determine the systemic risks.

The resulting consequence of these attack's initial events would possibly incur cascading failure to a grid. This paper quantifies the criticality of substation protective relays with the combination of the outage level and its corresponding severity risk index. The proposed hypothesized outages are based on the type of protective relaying, bus configuration of a substation, and commonly implemented relaying schemes, such as bus differential, directional overcurrent, and distance relays, are studied. This preliminary work also provides three approaches of determination in probabilities for sensitivity analysis. The proposed risk indices are evaluated using IEEE test systems.",

At a minimum this will mean there is confidence in a process to create a set of polygons that have unique identifiers coupled to geographical areas, and the ability to have these updated through a defined code of practice. Examples found across many countries are in the delivery of post, such as postcodes and zip codes, and of the definition of census areas and municipal boundaries. The confidence in these boundaries allows different data to be aggregated by third parties, which itself provides greater levels of data over comparable geographical areas to enhance wider analysis and decision making. Here we combine publicly available datasets published from the six regional electricity Distribution Network Operators of GB to produce a new geospatial dataset with 4436 unique polygons defining the areas served by electrical primary substations. An example is also presented of the use of these polygons to link postcode level open government datasets on domestic energy consumption (2015-2020) from the Department of Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ). This results in another dataset with energy statistics aggregated to the geographical areas served by each primary substation across Great Britain. Therefore, we believe there is a compelling argument for countries to set up processes to create and update polygons that have a meaningful relationship to energy systems. This would allow more accurate energy systems analysis to be performed, ultimately leading to an accelerated or potentially lower cost transition to a net-zero world.",

SCADA systems are essential to critical grid functions and include industrial control systems (ICS) protocols such as the Distributed Network Protocol-3 (DNP3). These protocols are vulnerable to cyber threats that power systems, as cyber-physical critical infrastructure, must be protected against. For this reason, the NERC Critical Infrastructure Protection standard CIP-005-5 specifies that an electronic system perimeter is needed, accomplished with firewalls. This paper presents how these electronic system perimeters can be optimally found and generated using a proposed meta-heuristic approach for optimal security zone formation for large-scale power systems. Then, to implement the optimal firewall rules in a large scale power system model, this work presents a prototype software tool that takes the optimization results and auto-configures the firewall nodes for different utilities in a cyber-physical testbed. Using this tool, firewall policies are configured for all the utilities and their substations within a synthetic 2000-bus model, assuming two different network topologies. Results generate the optimal electronic security perimeters to protect a power system's data flows and compare the number of firewalls, monetary cost, and risk alerts from path analysis.",

However, the susceptibility of SDN architecture to cyber-attacks has exhibited a notable increase in recent years, as indicated by research findings. This suggests a growing concern regarding the potential for cybersecurity breaches within the SDN framework. In this paper, we propose a hybrid intrusion detection system (IDS)-integrated SDN architecture for detecting and preventing the injection of malicious IEC 61850-based generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE) messages in a digital substation. Additionally, this program locates the fault's location and, as a form of mitigation, disables a certain port. Furthermore, implementation examples are demonstrated and verified using a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed that mimics the functioning of a digital substation.",

      "abstract": "District Heating (DH) systems are essential for energy-efficient urban heating. However, despite the advancements in automated fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), DH still faces challenges in operational faults that impact efficiency. This study introduces the Shared Nearest Neighbor Enhanced District Heating Anomaly Detection (SHEDAD) approach, designed to approximate the DH network topology and allow for local anomaly detection without disclosing sensitive information, such as substation locations. The approach leverages a multi-adaptive k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) graph to improve the initial neighborhood creation. Moreover, it introduces a merging technique that reduces noise and eliminates trivial edges. We use the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) and modified z-scores to flag anomalous substations. The results reveal that SHEDAD outperforms traditional clustering methods, achieving significantly lower intra-cluster variance and distance. Additionally, SHEDAD effectively isolates and identifies two distinct categories of anomalies: supply temperatures and substation performance. We identified 30 anomalous substations and reached a sensitivity of approximately 65\\% and specificity of approximately 97\\%. By focusing on this subset of poor-performing substations in the network, SHEDAD enables more targeted and effective maintenance interventions, which can reduce energy usage while optimizing network performance.",

      "abstract": "Power system components, particularly electrical substations, may be severely damaged due to flooding, resulting in prolonged power outages and resilience degradation. This problem is more severe in low-elevated regions such as Louisiana. Protective operational actions such as placing tiger dams around substations before flooding can reduce substation vulnerability, damage costs, and energy not supplied cost, thus enhancing power grid resilience. This paper proposes a stochastic mixed-integer programming model for protecting transmission substations one day before flood events using tiger dams. A flood-aware optimal power flow problem is formulated for transmission system operators with respect to the protected/unprotected status of substations. The formulated model aims to identify critical substations whose protection maximizes grid resilience. The output of the proposed model is a day-ahead crew team schedule for installing tiger dams on transmission substations. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated on a 6-bus system, and promising results are obtained.",

      "abstract": "The detection of critical infrastructures in large territories represented by aerial and satellite images is of high importance in several fields such as in security, anomaly detection, land use planning and land use change detection. However, the detection of such infrastructures is complex as they have highly variable shapes and sizes, i.e., some infrastructures, such as electrical substations, are too small while others, such as airports, are too large. Besides, airports can have a surface area either small or too large with completely different shapes, which makes its correct detection challenging. As far as we know, these limitations have not been tackled yet in previous works. This paper presents (1) a smart Critical Infrastructure dataset, named CI-dataset, organised into two scales, small and large scales critical infrastructures and (2) a two-level resolution-independent critical infrastructure detection (DetDSCI) methodology that first determines the spatial resolution of the input image using a classification model, then analyses the image using the appropriate detector for that spatial resolution. The present study targets two representative classes, airports and electrical substations. Our experiments show that DetDSCI methodology achieves up to 37,53% F1 improvement with respect to Faster R-CNN, one of the most influential detection models.",

      "abstract": "The installation of wireless technologies in power substations requires characterizing the impulsive noise produced by the high-voltage equipment. Substation impulsive noise might interfere with classic wireless communications and none of the existing models can reliably represent this noise in wide band. Previous studies have shown that impulsive noise is characterized by series of damped oscillations with the amplitude, the duration and the occurrence times of the impulses that are random. All these characteristics make this noise time-correlated and the partitioned Markov chain remains an efficient model that can ensure the correlation between the samples. In this study, we propose to design a partitioned Markov chain to generate an impulsive noise that is similar to the noise measured in existing substations, in time and frequency domains. We configure our Markov chain to produce the impulses with the damped oscillation effect, then, we determine the probability transition matrix and the distribution of each state of the Markov chain. Finally, we generate noise samples and we study the distribution of the impulsive noise characteristics. Our Markov chain model can replicate the correlation between the measured noise samples; also the distributions of the noise characteristics are similar in the simulations and the measurements.",

This puts forward higher requirements on the processing speed and accuracy of defect detection. Based on the end-to-end learning paradigm, this paper proposes an intelligent detection method for substation insulator defects based on CenterMask. First, the backbone network VoVNet is improved according to the residual connection and eSE module, which effectively solves the problems of deep network saturation and gradient information loss. On this basis, an insulator mask generation method based on a spatial attentiondirected mechanism is proposed. Insulators with complex image backgrounds are accurately segmented. Then, three strategies of pixel-wise regression prediction, multi-scale features and centerness are introduced. The anchor-free single-stage target detector accurately locates the defect points of insulators. Finally, an example analysis is carried out with the substation inspection image of a power supply company in a certain area to verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.",

The purpose is go forward to automation distribution and its implementation in isolated power systems where control capabilities are limited and it is common using the same applications as in continental power systems. This means that lot of functionalities do not apply and computational burden generates high response times. A fuzzy controller, with logic guidelines embedded based upon heuristic rules resulting from operators at dispatch control center past experience, has been designed. Working as an on-line tool, it has been tested under real conditions and it has managed the operation during a whole day in a distribution substation. Within the limits of control capabilities of the system, the controller maintained successfully an acceptable voltage profile, power factor values over 0,98 and it has ostensibly improved the performance given by an optimal power flow based automation system.",

      "abstract": "Within electrical distribution networks, substation constraints management requires that aggregated power demand from residential users is kept within suitable bounds. Efficiency of substation constraints management can be measured as the reduction of constraints violations w.r.t. unmanaged demand. Home batteries hold the promise of enabling efficient and user-oblivious substation constraints management. Centralized control of home batteries would achieve optimal efficiency. However, it is hardly acceptable by users, since service providers (e.g., utilities or aggregators) would directly control batteries at user premises. Unfortunately, devising efficient hierarchical control strategies, thus overcoming the above problem, is far from easy.   We present a novel two-layer control strategy for home batteries that avoids direct control of home devices by the service provider and at the same time yields near-optimal substation constraints management efficiency. Our simulation results on field data from 62 households in Denmark show that the substation constraints management efficiency achieved with our approach is at least 82% of the one obtained with a theoretical optimal centralized strategy.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity breaches in digital substations can pose significant challenges to the stability and reliability of power system operations. To address these challenges, defense and mitigation techniques are required. Identifying and detecting anomalies in information and communication technology (ICT) is crucial to ensure secure device interactions within digital substations. This paper proposes a task-oriented dialogue (ToD) system for anomaly detection (AD) in datasets of multicast messages e.g., generic object oriented substation event (GOOSE) and sampled value (SV) in digital substations using large language models (LLMs). This model has a lower potential error and better scalability and adaptability than a process that considers the cybersecurity guidelines recommended by humans, known as the human-in-the-loop (HITL) process. Also, this methodology significantly reduces the effort required when addressing new cyber threats or anomalies compared with machine learning (ML) techniques, since it leaves the models complexity and precision unaffected and offers a faster implementation. These findings present a comparative assessment, conducted utilizing standard and advanced performance evaluation metrics for the proposed AD framework and the HITL process. To generate and extract datasets of IEC 61850 communications, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testbed was employed.",
