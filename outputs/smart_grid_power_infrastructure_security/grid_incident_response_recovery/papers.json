      "abstract": "This paper presents the development of \"Control-Sync,\" a novel firmware for universal inverters in microgrids, designed to enhance grid stability and flexibility. As hybrid PV-battery systems become increasingly prevalent, there is a critical need for inverters capable of efficiently transitioning between grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) modes. Our firmware introduces dual control paths that allow for seamless transitions without reliance on external control devices, reducing communication overhead and increasing operational reliability. Key features include direct phase-angle detection and frequency restoration capabilities, essential for managing asymmetrical power grids and dynamic load changes. The efficacy of Control-Sync is demonstrated through rigorous testing with grid emulators and multi-phase inverters, confirming its potential to improve microgrid reliability and efficiency. This study offers a scalable solution to enhance inverter adaptability in various grid conditions, fostering a more resilient energy infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "The large-scale integration of inverter-interfaced renewable energy sources presents significant challenges to maintaining power balance and nominal frequency in modern power systems. This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.",

Along with climate change and consumer behavioral changes, this leads to changes and variability in generation and load patterns, introducing significant complexity and uncertainty into grid planning and operations. While the industry has already started to exploit AI to overcome computational challenges of established grid simulation tools, we propose the use of AI Foundation Models (FMs) and advances in Graph Neural Networks to efficiently exploit poorly available grid data for different downstream tasks, enhancing grid operations. For capturing the grid's underlying physics, we believe that building a self-supervised model learning the power flow dynamics is a critical first step towards developing an FM for the power grid.

The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.",

      "abstract": "The successful integration of machine learning models into decision support tools for grid operation hinges on effectively capturing the topological changes in daily operations. Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.",

      "abstract": "Power restoration is an urgent task after a black-out, and recovery efficiency is critical when quantifying system resilience. Multiple elements should be considered to restore the power system quickly and safely. This paper proposes a recovery model to solve a direct-current optimal power flow (DCOPF) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Since most of the generators cannot start independently, the interaction between black-start (BS) and non-black-start (NBS) generators must be modeled appropriately. The energization status of the NBS is coordinated with the recovery status of transmission lines, and both of them are modeled as binary variables. Also, only after an NBS unit receives cranking power through connected transmission lines, will it be allowed to participate in the following system dispatch. The amount of cranking power is estimated as a fixed proportion of the maximum generation capacity. The proposed model is validated on several test systems, as well as a 1393-bus representation system of the Puerto Rican electric power grid. Test results demonstrate how the recovery of NBS units and damaged transmission lines can be optimized, resulting in an efficient and well-coordinated recovery procedure.",

      "abstract": "Modern power systems are facing the tremendous challenge of integrating vast amounts of variable (non-dispatchable) renewable generation capacity, such as solar photovoltaic or wind power. In this context, the required power system flexibility needs to be allocated in other units that can include energy storage, demand management or providing reserve from renewables curtailing the output power. The present paper proposes the new concept of grid-forming load, which can be considered a totally flexible concept of demand. The concept is not only ensuring the load is supporting the grid stability by adapting the load to the overall system balancing, but also ensures that the load is actually contributing to form the grid and to provide synchronization power to the overall system. In this sense, the new concept allows running a system powered only by renewables operating at maximum power (or operator defined set-point) in grid-following mode, while the overall system control is ubicated in the demand side. This is an important change of paradigm as it considers that all the flexibility, synchronism and stability provision is on the demand side. This concept can applied either to isolated systems or also to future power systems, where millions of loads steer the power system while the renewables are operating at full power. The paper proposes the concept, suggests possible control implementations of the grid-forming load and analyses the concept in four simulation case studies.",

      "abstract": "The integration of synchronous generators and energy storage systems operated through communication networks introduces new challenges and vulnerabilities to the electric grid, where cyber attacks can corrupt sensor measurements or control inputs and interrupt functions such as frequency regulation. This paper proposes a defense methodology for the design of resilient operating constraints imposed on each generation and storage unit in order to prevent any attack sequence from driving the system's frequency to unsafe conditions. The resilient operating constraints are found by using ellipsoidal approximations of the reachable set of the power system, leading to a convex optimization problem with linear matrix inequalities. Numerical results in a single-area power system with synchronous generation and energy storage demonstrate how the resilient constraints provide security guarantees against any type of attack affecting frequency measurements or controller setpoints.",

      "abstract": "In the current practice of short-term power scheduling, online power reserves are used to address generation mismatches and contingencies. Neither online inertia nor the speed of the committed units is considered in the scheduling process. With the increasing injection of uncertain renewable energy sources, this practice is starting to fall short especially in island power systems, where the primary frequency response is already scarce, and any contingency leads to potentially poor frequency response. This paper introduces a data driven linear constraint to improve the post-fault frequency quality in island power systems. A coherent initial data-set is obtained by simulating the system frequency response of single outages. Then logistic regression is employed as a predictive analytic procedure to differentiate the acceptable and unacceptable incidents. To compare the conventional methods with the proposed approach and also to handle the uncertain nature of renewable energy generation, an adaptive robust unit commitment formulation is utilized. Results for the island power system of La Palma show that depending on the chosen cut-point on the logistic regression estimation the proposed method can improve the frequency response quality of the system while reducing the operation costs.",

We first construct dynamic components for picturing the power system operation as the environment. The transient voltage recovery criteria, which poses time-varying requirements to UVLS, is integrated into the states and reward function to advise the learning of deep neural networks. The proposed approach has no tuning issue of coefficients in reward functions, and this issue was regarded as a deficiency in the existing DRL-based algorithms. Extensive case studies illustrate that the proposed method outperforms the traditional UVLS relay in both the timeliness and efficacy for emergency control.",

These models enforce physical and operational limits by optimally allocating active power imbalances among available generators and deciding the bus type to switch from the PV type to the PQ type. The efficacy of this method is numerically validated on the IEEE 30-bus, 300-bus, and 118-bus systems with 12, 10, and 100 contingencies, respectively.",

      "abstract": "When the electric grid in a region suffers a major outage, e.g., after a catastrophic cyber attack, a \"black start\" may be required, where the grid is slowly restarted, carefully and incrementally adding generating capacity and demand. To ensure safe and effective black start, the grid control center has to be able to communicate with field personnel and with supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Voice and text communication are particularly critical. As part of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Rapid Attack Detection, Isolation, and Characterization Systems (RADICS) program, we designed, tested and evaluated a self-configuring mesh network architecture and prototype called the Phoenix Secure Emergency Network (PhoenixSEN). PhoenixSEN is designed as a drop-in replacement for primary communication networks, combines existing and new technologies, can work with a variety of link-layer protocols, emphasizes manageability and auto-configuration, and provides a core set of services and applications for coordination of people and devices including voice, text, and SCADA communication. The PhoenixSEN prototype was evaluated in the field through a series of DARPA-led exercises. The same system is also likely to support coordination of recovery efforts after large-scale natural disasters.",

      "abstract": "The paradigm shift in the electric power grid necessitates a revisit of existing control methods to ensure the grid's security and resilience. In particular, the increased uncertainties and rapidly changing operational conditions in power systems have revealed outstanding issues in terms of either speed, adaptiveness, or scalability of the existing control methods for power systems. On the other hand, the availability of massive real-time data can provide a clearer picture of what is happening in the grid. Recently, deep reinforcement learning(RL) has been regarded and adopted as a promising approach leveraging massive data for fast and adaptive grid control. However, like most existing machine learning (ML)-basedcontrol techniques, RL control usually cannot guarantee the safety of the systems under control. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for safe RL-based load shedding of power systems that can enhance the safe voltage recovery of the electric power grid after experiencing faults. Numerical simulations on the 39-bus IEEE benchmark is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safe RL emergency control, as well as its adaptive capability to faults not seen in the training.",

      "abstract": "With the emergence of smart grids as the primary means of distribution across wide areas, the importance of improving its resilience to faults and mishaps is increasing. The reliability of a distribution system depends upon its tolerance to attacks and the efficiency of restoration after an attack occurs. This paper proposes a unique approach to the restoration of smart grids under attack by impostors or due to natural calamities via optimal islanding of the grid with primary generators and distributed generators(DGs) into sub-grids minimizing the amount of load shed which needs to be incurred and at the same time minimizing the number of switching operations via graph theory. The minimum load which needs to be shed is computed in the first stage followed by selecting the nodes whose load needs to be shed to achieve such a configuration and then finally deriving the sequence of switching operations required to achieve the configuration. The proposed method is tested against standard IEEE 37-bus and a 1069-bus grid system and the minimum load shed along with the sequencing steps to optimal configuration and time to achieve such a configuration are presented which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method when compared to the existing methods in the field. Moreover, the proposed algorithm can be easily modified to incorporate any other constraints which might arise due to any operational configuration of the grid.",

      "abstract": "Extreme weather events have a significant impact on the aging and outdated power distribution infrastructures. These high-impact low-probability (HILP) events often result in extended outages and loss of critical services, thus, severely affecting customers' safety. This calls for the need to ensure resilience in distribution networks by quickly restoring the critical services during a disaster. This paper presents an advanced feeder restoration method to restore critical loads using distributed energy resources (DERs). A resilient restoration approach is proposed that jointly maximizes the amount of restored critical loads and optimizes the restoration times by optimally allocating grid's available DER resources. The restoration problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program with the objective of maximizing the resilience to post-restoration failures while simultaneously satisfying grid's critical connectivity and operational constraints and ensuring a radial operation for a given open-loop feeder configuration. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using IEEE 123-node feeder with 5 DERs supplying 11 critical loads and IEEE 906-bus feeder with 3 DERs supplying 17 critical loads. The impacts of DER availability and fuel reserve on restored networks are assessed and it is shown that the proposed approach is successfully able to restore a maximum number of critical loads using available DERs.",

Existing emergency control schemes are usually designed off-line based on either the conceived \"worst\" case scenario or a few typical operation scenarios. These schemes are facing significant adaptiveness and robustness issues as increasing uncertainties and variations occur in modern electrical grids. To address these challenges, for the first time, this paper developed novel adaptive emergency control schemes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), by leveraging the high-dimensional feature extraction and non-linear generalization capabilities of DRL for complex power systems. Furthermore, an open-source platform named RLGC has been designed for the first time to assist the development and benchmarking of DRL algorithms for power system control. Details of the platform and DRL-based emergency control schemes for generator dynamic braking and under-voltage load shedding are presented. Extensive case studies performed in both two-area four-machine system and IEEE 39-Bus system have demonstrated the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed schemes.",

      "abstract": "Future power distribution grids will comprise a large number of components, each potentially able to carry out operations autonomously. Clearly, in order to ensure safe operation of the grid, individual operations must be coordinated among the different components. Since operation safety is a global property, modelling component coordination typically involves reasoning about systems at a global level. In this paper, we propose a language for specifying grid operation control protocols from a global point of view. We show how such global specifications can be used to automatically generate local controllers of individual components, and that the distributed implementation yielded by such controllers operationally corresponds to the global specification. We showcase our development by modelling a fault management scenario in power grids.",

      "abstract": "Power grids normally operate at some stable operating condition where power supply and demand are balanced. In response to emergency situations, load shedding is a prevailing approach where local protective devices are activated to cut a suitable amount of load to quickly rebalance the supply demand and hopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control results in interrupted service with severe economic damage to customers. Also, such control is usually less effective due to the lack of coordination among protective devices. In this paper, we propose a novel structural emergency control to render post-fault dynamics from the critical/emergency fault-cleared state to the stable equilibrium point. This is a new control paradigm that does not rely on any continuous measurement or load shedding, as in the classical setup. Instead, the grid is made stable by discretely relocating the equilibrium point and its stability region such that the system is consecutively attracted from the fault-cleared state back to the original equilibrium point. The proposed control is designed by solving linear and convex optimization problems, making it possibly scalable to large-scale power grids. Finally, this emergency control scheme can be implemented by exploiting transmission facilities available on the existing grids.",

However, due to security reasons, such topologies and particularly the locations of the substations and the lines are usually not publicly available. Therefore, we study the structural properties of the North American grids and present an algorithm for generating synthetic spatially embedded networks with similar properties to a given grid. The algorithm uses the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for density estimation of the node positions and generates a set of nodes with similar spatial distribution to the nodes in a given network. Then, it uses two procedures, which are inspired by the historical evolution of the grids, to connect the nodes. The algorithm has several tunable parameters that allow generating grids similar to any given grid. Particularly, we apply it to the Western Interconnection (WI) and to grids that operate under the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) and the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC), and show that it generates grids with similar structural and spatial properties to these grids. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to consider the spatial distribution of the nodes and lines and its importance in generating synthetic power grids.",

It has been documented that PEVs serving as V2G systems can offer possible backup for renewable power sources, can provide reactive power support, active power regulation, load balancing, peak load shaving,% and current harmonic filtering, can provide ancillary services as frequency control and spinning reserves, can improve grid efficiency, stability, reliability, and generation dispatch, can reduce utility operating costs and can generate revenue. Here we show that PEVs can even improve power grid transient stability, that is, stability when the power grid is subjected to large disturbances, including bus faults, generator and branch tripping, and sudden large load changes. A control strategy that regulates the power output of a fleet of PEVs based on the speed of generator turbines is proposed and tested on the New England 10-unit 39-bus power system. By regulating the power output of the PEVs we show that (1) speed and voltage fluctuations resulting from large disturbances can be significantly reduced up to 5 times, and (2) the critical clearing time can be extended by 20-40%. Overall, the PEVs control strategy makes the power grid more robust.",

Due to lack of the proper security measures, a major blackout may occur which can even lead to a cascading failure. Therefore, to protect this critical power system infrastructure and to ensure a reliable and an uninterrupted power supply to the end users, smart grid security issues must be addressed with high priority. In a smart grid environment, electric power infrastructure is modernized by incorporating the current and future requirements and advanced functionalities to its consumers. To make the smart grid happen, cyber system is integrated with the physical power system. Although adoption of cyber system has made the grid more energy efficient and modernized, it has introduced cyber-attack issues which are critical for national infrastructure security and customer satisfaction. Due to the cyber-attack, power grid may face operational failures and loss of synchronization. This operational failure may damage critical power system components which may interrupt the power supply and make the system unstable resulting high financial penalties. In this chapter, some recent cyber attack related incidents into a smart grid environment are discussed. The requirements and the state of the art of cyber security issues of a critical power system infrastructure are illustrated elaborately.",
