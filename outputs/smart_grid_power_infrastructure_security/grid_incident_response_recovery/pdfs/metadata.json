      "abstract": "Due to the increasing load demand, the operating state of modern power systems are become closing to their critical levels. Moreover, the modern power systems are integrated with a large amount of fast-response dynamic elements, so the short-term voltage stability (STVS) issues should be taken seriously. In order to improve the STVS of power systems, we can optimize the dynamic VAR reserve under contingency set. However, the scale of actual power grids is usually large, so it is hard to solve the overall optimization problem directly. To reduce the difficulty of solving the problem, a practical grid-partitioning method considering the dynamic VAR response of power grid under contingency set is proposed in this paper, to decompose the overall problem into several sub-problems. The buses in each region are similar in terms of voltage response to dynamic VARs and contingencies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified based on a region power grid model of China.",

Given the fast, complex process of cascading propagation, corrective actions such as optimal load shedding (OLS) are difficult to attain in large-scale networks due to the computation complexity and communication latency issues. This work puts forth an innovative learning-for-OLS approach by constructing the optimal decision rules of load shedding under a variety of potential contingency scenarios through offline neural network (NN) training. Notably, the proposed NN-based OLS decisions are fully decentralized, enabling individual load centers to quickly react to the specific contingency using readily available local measurements.

The optimal load shedding (OLS) accounting for network limits has the potential to address the diverse system-wide impacts of contingency scenarios as compared to traditional local schemes. However, due to the fast cascading propagation of initial contingencies, real-time OLS solutions are challenging to attain in large systems with high computation and communication needs. In this paper, we propose a decentralized design that leverages offline training of a neural network (NN) model for individual load centers to autonomously construct the OLS solutions from locally available measurements. Our learning-for-OLS approach can greatly reduce the computation and communication needs during online emergency responses, thus preventing the cascading propagation of contingencies for enhanced power grid resilience.

      "abstract": "Operating a modern power grid reliably in case of SCADA/EMS failure or amid difficult times like COVID-19 pandemic is a challenging task for grid operators. In [11], a PMU-based emergency generation dispatch scheme has been proposed to help the system operators with the supply and demand balancing; however, its realization highly relies on the control center infrastructure for computing and communication. This work, rather than using the on-premises server and dispatch communication system, proposes and implements a cloud-centric serverless architecture to ensure the operation continuity regardless of local infrastructure's availability and accessibility. Through its prototype implementation and evaluation at ISO New England, the solution has demonstrated two major advantages. Firstly, the cloud infrastructure is independent and fault-tolerant, providing grid monitoring and control capability even when EMS loses the corresponding functionality or when operators need to work remotely away from the control center. Secondly, the overall design is event-driven using serverless cloud services in response to the SCADA/EMS failure event. Thanks to \"serverless\", the burden of the server provisioning and maintenance can be avoided from the user side. The cost of using public cloud services for this solution is extremely low since it is architected and implemented based on the event-driven Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model. This work also develops a comprehensive cyber security mechanism to comply with critical infrastructure requirements for the power grid, which can serve as an exemplary framework for other grid operators to secure their cloud services.",

      "abstract": "Smart grid security is crucial to maintain stable and reliable power system operation during the contingency situation due to the failure of any critical power system component. Ensuring a secured smart grid involves with a less possibility of power grid collapse or equipment malfunction. Due to lack of the proper security measures, a major blackout may occur which can even lead to a cascading failure. Therefore, to protect this critical power system infrastructure and to ensure a reliable and an uninterrupted power supply to the end users, smart grid security issues must be addressed with high priority. In a smart grid environment, electric power infrastructure is modernized by incorporating the current and future requirements and advanced functionalities to its consumers. To make the smart grid happen, cyber system is integrated with the physical power system. Although adoption of cyber system has made the grid more energy efficient and modernized, it has introduced cyber-attack issues which are critical for national infrastructure security and customer satisfaction. Due to the cyber-attack, power grid may face operational failures and loss of synchronization. This operational failure may damage critical power system components which may interrupt the power supply and make the system unstable resulting high financial penalties. In this chapter, some recent cyber attack related incidents into a smart grid environment are discussed. The requirements and the state of the art of cyber security issues of a critical power system infrastructure are illustrated elaborately.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, a photovoltaic (PV) reconfigurable grid-tied inverter (RGTI) scheme is proposed. Unlike a conventional GTI that ceases operation during a power outage, the RGTI is designed to act as a regular GTI in the on-grid mode but it is reconfigured to function as a DC-DC charge-controller that continues operation during a grid outage. During this period, the RGTI is tied to the battery-bank of an external UPS based backup power system to augment it with solar power. Such an operation in off-grid mode without employing communication with the UPS is challenging, as the control of RGTI must not conflict with the battery management system of the UPS. The hardware and control design aspects of this requirement are discussed in this paper. A battery emulation control scheme is proposed for the RGTI that facilitates seamless functioning of the RGTI in parallel with the physical UPS battery to reduce its discharge current. A system-level control scheme for overall operation and power management is presented to handle the dynamic variations in solar irradiation and UPS loads during the day, such that the battery discharge burden is minimized. The design and operation of the proposed RGTI system are independent of the external UPS and can be integrated with an UPS supplied by any manufacturer. Experimental results on a 4~kVA hardware setup validate the proposed RGTI concept, its operation and control.",

      "abstract": "Deploying distributed energy resources (DERs) and other smart grid technologies have increased the complexity of power grids and made them more vulnerable to natural disasters and cyber-physical-human (CPH) threats. To deal with these extreme events, proactive plans are required by utilities to minimize the damages caused by CPH threats. This paper proposes a proactive rolling-horizon-based scheme for the resilience-oriented operation of hydrogen (H2) systems in integrated distribution and transmission networks. The proposed framework is a bi-level model in which the upper-level is focused on distribution system operation in both normal and emergency operation modes, and the lower-level problem accounts for the transmission network operation. Two preeminent aspects of H2 systems are considered in this paper, 1) to show the flexibility of H2 systems, capacity-based demand response signals are considered for electrolyzers, stationary fuel cell (FC) units, and H2 storage tanks are considered in both normal and emergency operation modes; 2) unlike the batteries which can only charge and discharge energy based on maximum duration times and power ratings, H2 systems can be considered as the flexible long-term energy storage by storing H2 for days and supplying power to FC in the case of \\textit{N-m} outages lasting for more than 10 hours. Moreover, H2 production cost based on water electrolysis and storage costs is calculated. Simulation results demonstrate that utilities can improve the system-level resilience using H2 systems as long-term backup power resources.",

The resulting increase in communication creates a larger attack surface for malicious actors. Indeed, cyber attacks on power grids have already succeeded in causing temporary, large-scale blackouts in the recent past. In this paper, we analyze the communication infrastructure of power grids to derive resulting fundamental challenges of power grids with respect to cybersecurity. Based on these challenges, we identify a broad set of resulting attack vectors and attack scenarios that threaten the security of power grids. To address these challenges, we propose to rely on a defense-in-depth strategy, which encompasses measures for (i) device and application security, (ii) network security, (iii) physical security, as well as (iv) policies, procedures, and awareness. For each of these categories, we distill and discuss a comprehensive set of state-of-the art approaches, and identify further opportunities to strengthen cybersecurity in interconnected power grids.",

However, given the complex cyber-physical nature of power grids, it is hard to respond timely with limited costs for deploying additional cyber and/or phyiscal resources, such as during a high-impact low-frequency cyber-physical event. Therefore, the paper examines the design of cooperative cyber-physical resource optimization solutions to control grid-tied cyber and physical resources. First, the operation of a cyber-physical power system is formulated into a constrained optimization problem, including the cyber and physical objectives and constraints. Then, a bi-level solution is provided to obtain optimal cyber and physical actions, including the reconfiguration of cyber topology (e.g., activation of communication links) in the cyber layer and the control of physical resources (e.g., energy storage systems) in the physical layer. The developed method improves grid resilience during cyberattacks and can provide guidance on the control of coupled physical side resources. Numerical simulation on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

      "abstract": "Contingency Analysis (CA) is a core component of the Energy Management System (EMS) in the power grid. The goal of CA is to operate the power system in a secure manner by analyzing the system subject to a contingency (e.g., the outage of a transmission line or a power generator) to determine the setpoints that will allow system operation without violation of constraints. The analysis in CA is conducted based on the output from State Estimation (SE), another core EMS module. However, it is also shown that an adversary can alter certain power measurements to corrupt the system states estimated by SE without being detected. Such a corrupted estimation can severely skew the results of the contingency analysis as it will provide a fake model to deal with. In this research, we formally model necessary interdependency relationships and systematically analyze these novel attacks on the contingency analysis. In particular, this research focuses on Security Constrained Optimal Power Flow (SCOPF) that finds out the optimal economic dispatches considering a single line failure (based on the $n - 1$ contingency analysis) and transmission line capacities. The proposed model is implemented and solved to find out potential threat vectors (i.e., a set of measurements to be altered) that can evade CA so that the system will face overloading situation on one or more transmission lines when some specific contingencies happen. We demonstrate our formal model on an IEEE 14 bus system-based case study and verify the results with a standard PowerWorld model. We further evaluate the model with respect to various attacks and grid characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Electrical energy is a vital part of modern life, and expectations for grid resilience to allow a continuous and reliable energy supply has tremendously increased even during adverse events (e.g., Ukraine cyber-attack, Hurricane Maria). The global pandemic COVID-19 has raised the electric energy reliability risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and increased possible cybersecurity threats. The pandemic introduces a significant degree of uncertainly to the grid operation in the presence of other extreme events like natural disasters, unprecedented outages, aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, and cyber-attacks. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events. Solutions to manage such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: a) emergency planning and organizational support, b) following safety protocol, c) utilizing enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness, and d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support. Enhanced digitalization and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels, including generation, transmission, and distribution. These data or information can be utilized to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques for automation and increased power grid resilience.

This includes utilizing upward flexibility or reserves of remaining online generators and some curtailment or shifting of flexible loads, which results in higher costs. Using price signals and market-based coordination, the grid operator can achieve its objectives without direct control over distributed energy resources and is able to accurately compensate prosumers for the grid support they provide.",

However, the development, validation, and testing of data-driven countermeasures against cyber-attacks, such as machine learning-based detection approaches, lack important data from real-world cyber incidents. Unlike attack data from real-world cyber incidents, infrastructure knowledge and standards are accessible through expert and domain knowledge. Our proposed approach uses domain knowledge to define the behavior of a smart grid under non-attack conditions and detect attack patterns and anomalies. Using a graph-based specification formalism, we combine cross-domain knowledge that enables the generation of whitelisting rules not only for statically defined protocol fields but also for communication ows and technical operation boundaries. Finally, we evaluate our specification-based intrusion detection system against various attack scenarios and assess detection quality and performance. In particular, we investigate a data manipulation attack in a future-orientated use case of an IEC 60870-based SCADA system that controls distributed energy resources in the distribution grid. Our approach can detect severe data manipulation attacks with high accuracy in a timely and reliable manner.",

Integrating these new technologies has resulted in more interconnections and interdependencies between the physical and cyber components of the grid. Natural disasters and man-made perturbations have begun to threaten grid integrity more often. Urban infrastructure networks are highly reliant on the electric grid and consequently, the vulnerability of infrastructure networks to electric grid outages is becoming a major global concern. In order to minimize the economic, social, and political impacts of power system outages, the grid must be resilient. The concept of a power system cyber-physical resilience centers around maintaining system states at a stable level in the presence of disturbances. Resilience is a multidimensional property of the electric grid, it requires managing disturbances originating from physical component failures, cyber component malfunctions, and human attacks. In the electric grid community, there is not a clear and universally accepted definition of cyber-physical resilience. This paper focuses on the definition of resilience for the electric grid and reviews key concepts related to system resilience. This paper aims to advance the field not only by adding cyber-physical resilience concepts to power systems vocabulary, but also by proposing a new way of thinking about grid operation with unexpected disturbances and hazards and leveraging distributed energy resources.",

An attack graph depicting the propagation of potential cyber-attack sequences from the initial access point to the end objective is vital to identify critical weaknesses of any cyber-physical system. A cyber security personnel can accordingly plan preventive mitigation measures for the identified weaknesses addressing the cyber-attack sequences. However, limitations on available cybersecurity budget restrict the choice of mitigation measures. We address this aspect through our framework, which solves the following problem: given potential cyber-attack sequences for a cyber-physical component in the power grid, find the optimal manner to allocate an available budget to implement necessary preventive mitigation measures. We formulate the problem as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) to identify the optimal budget partition and set of mitigation measures which minimize the vulnerability of cyber-physical components to potential attack sequences. We assume that the allocation of budget affects the efficacy of the mitigation measures. We show how altering the budget allocation for tasks such as asset management, cybersecurity infrastructure improvement, incident response planning and employee training affects the choice of the optimal set of preventive mitigation measures and modifies the associated cybersecurity risk. The proposed framework can be used by cyber policymakers and system owners to allocate optimal budgets for various tasks required to improve the overall security of a cyber-physical system.",

      "abstract": "Improving the reliability of power distribution systems is critically important for both utilities and customers. This calls for an efficient service restoration module within a distribution management system to support the implementation of self-healing smart grid networks. The emerging smart grid technologies, including distributed generators (DGs) and remote-controlled switches, although enhance the self-healing capability and allow faster recovery, pose additional complexity to the service restoration problem, especially under cold load pickup (CLPU) conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage restoration framework to generate restoration solutions with a sequence of control actions. The first stage generates a restoration plan that supports both the traditional service restoration using feeder reconfiguration and the grid-forming DG-assisted intentional islanding methods. The second stage generates an optimal sequence of switching operations to bring the outaged system quickly to the final restored configuration. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program that incorporates system connectivity, operating constraints, and CLPU models. It is demonstrated using a multi-feeder test case that the proposed framework is effective in utilizing all available resources to quickly restore the service and generates an optimal sequence of switching actions to be used by the operator to reach the desired optimal configuration.",

This study introduces a multilayer Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework to enhance PdM and enable resilience-based substation clustering. Using seven years of incident data from Oklahoma Gas & Electric (292,830 records across 347 substations), the framework integrates Graph Attention Networks (spatial), Graph Convolutional Networks (temporal), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (causal), fused through attention-weighted embeddings. Our model achieves a 30-day F1-score of 0.8935 +/- 0.0258, outperforming XGBoost and Random Forest by 3.2% and 2.7%, and single-layer GNNs by 10 to 15 percent. Removing the causal layer drops performance to 0.7354 +/- 0.0418. For resilience analysis, HDBSCAN clustering on HierarchicalRiskGNN embeddings identifies eight operational risk groups. The highest-risk cluster (Cluster 5, 44 substations) shows 388.4 incidents/year and 602.6-minute recovery time, while low-risk groups report fewer than 62 incidents/year. ANOVA (p < 0.0001) confirms significant inter-cluster separation. Our clustering outperforms K-Means and Spectral Clustering with a Silhouette Score of 0.626 and Davies-Bouldin index of 0.527.

Emerging ancillary power markets provide new incentives to consumers (e.g., electrical vehicles, data centers, and others) to perform demand response to help stabilize the electricity grid. A promising class of potential demand response providers includes energy storage systems (ESSs). This paper evaluates the benefits of using various types of novel ESS technologies for a variety of emerging smart grid demand response programs, such as regulation services reserves (RSRs), contingency reserves, and peak shaving. We model, formulate and solve optimization problems to maximize the net profit of ESSs in providing each demand response. Our solution selects the optimal power and energy capacities of the ESS, determines the optimal reserve value to provide as well as the ESS real-time operational policy for program participation. Our results highlight that applying ultra-capacitors and flywheels in RSR has the potential to be up to 30 times more profitable than using common battery technologies such as LI and LA batteries for peak shaving.",

With a goal of restoring electric service in the shortest time, the core decisions in restoration planning are to partition the grid into sub-networks, each of which has an initial power source for black-start (called sectionalization problem), and then restart all generators in each network (called generator startup sequencing problem or GSS) as soon as possible. Due to the complexity of each problem, the sectionalization and GSS problems are usually solved separately, often resulting in a sub-optimal solution. Our paper develops models and computational methods to solve the two problems simultaneously. We first study the computational complexity of the GSS problem and develop an efficient integer linear programming formulation. We then integrate the GSS problem with the sectionalization problem and develop an integer linear programming formulation for the parallel power system restoration (PPSR) problem to find exact optimal solutions. To solve larger systems, we then develop bounding approaches that find good upper and lower bounds efficiently. Finally, to address computational challenges for very large power grids, we develop a randomized approach to find a high-quality feasible solution quickly. Our computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches are able to find good solutions for PPSR in up to 2000-bus systems.",

The minimum load which needs to be shed is computed in the first stage followed by selecting the nodes whose load needs to be shed to achieve such a configuration and then finally deriving the sequence of switching operations required to achieve the configuration. The proposed method is tested against standard IEEE 37-bus and a 1069-bus grid system and the minimum load shed along with the sequencing steps to optimal configuration and time to achieve such a configuration are presented which demonstrates the effectiveness of the method when compared to the existing methods in the field.

Frequent grid reconfigurations and N-k security analyses have to be conducted to ensure a reliable and secure power grid, leading to a vast combinatorial space of possible topologies and operating states. This combinatorial complexity, which increases with grid size, poses a significant computational challenge for traditional solvers. In this paper, we combine Physics-Informed Neural Networks with graph-aware neural network architectures, i.e., a Guided-Dropout (GD) and an Edge-Varying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture to learn the set points for a grid that considers all probable single-line reconfigurations (all critical N-1 scenarios) and subsequently apply the trained models to N-k scenarios. We demonstrate how incorporating the underlying physical equations for the network equations within the training procedure of the GD and the GNN architectures performs with N-1, N-2, and N-3 case studies. Using the AC Power Flow as a guiding application, we test our methods on the 6-bus, 24-bus, 57-bus, and 118-bus systems. We find that GNN not only achieves the task of contingency screening with satisfactory accuracy but does this up to 400 times faster than the Newton-Raphson power flow solver. Moreover, our results provide a comparison of the GD and GNN models in terms of accuracy and computational speed and provide recommendations on their adoption for contingency analysis of power systems.",

We first construct dynamic components for picturing the power system operation as the environment. The transient voltage recovery criteria, which poses time-varying requirements to UVLS, is integrated into the states and reward function to advise the learning of deep neural networks. The proposed approach has no tuning issue of coefficients in reward functions, and this issue was regarded as a deficiency in the existing DRL-based algorithms.

We show how this approach may close the gap between the industry needs and current grid analysis capabilities, to bring the industry closer to optimal grid operation and planning.",

This paper studies grid-level coordinated control of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for scalable and optimal frequency control. We propose a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm based on the projected primal-dual gradient method and by leveraging the structure of the underlying physical system dynamics. The proposed algorithm i) restores the nominal system frequency while minimizing total control cost and enforcing IBR power capacity limits and line thermal constraints, and ii) operates in a distributed manner that only needs local measurements and neighbor-to-neighbor communication. In particular, when the line thermal constraints are disregarded, the proposed algorithm admits a fully local implementation that requires no communication, while still ensuring optimality and satisfying IBR power capacity limits. We establish the global asymptotic convergence of the algorithm using Lyapunov stability analysis. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithms are validated through high-fidelity, 100% inverter-based electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.",

      "abstract": "The paradigm shift in the electric power grid necessitates a revisit of existing control methods to ensure the grid's security and resilience. In particular, the increased uncertainties and rapidly changing operational conditions in power systems have revealed outstanding issues in terms of either speed, adaptiveness, or scalability of the existing control methods for power systems. On the other hand, the availability of massive real-time data can provide a clearer picture of what is happening in the grid. Recently, deep reinforcement learning(RL) has been regarded and adopted as a promising approach leveraging massive data for fast and adaptive grid control. However, like most existing machine learning (ML)-basedcontrol techniques, RL control usually cannot guarantee the safety of the systems under control. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for safe RL-based load shedding of power systems that can enhance the safe voltage recovery of the electric power grid after experiencing faults. Numerical simulations on the 39-bus IEEE benchmark is performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed safe RL emergency control, as well as its adaptive capability to faults not seen in the training.",

Multiple elements should be considered to restore the power system quickly and safely. This paper proposes a recovery model to solve a direct-current optimal power flow (DCOPF) based on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP). Since most of the generators cannot start independently, the interaction between black-start (BS) and non-black-start (NBS) generators must be modeled appropriately. The energization status of the NBS is coordinated with the recovery status of transmission lines, and both of them are modeled as binary variables. Also, only after an NBS unit receives cranking power through connected transmission lines, will it be allowed to participate in the following system dispatch. The amount of cranking power is estimated as a fixed proportion of the maximum generation capacity. The proposed model is validated on several test systems, as well as a 1393-bus representation system of the Puerto Rican electric power grid. Test results demonstrate how the recovery of NBS units and damaged transmission lines can be optimized, resulting in an efficient and well-coordinated recovery procedure.",

Here we show that PEVs can even improve power grid transient stability, that is, stability when the power grid is subjected to large disturbances, including bus faults, generator and branch tripping, and sudden large load changes. A control strategy that regulates the power output of a fleet of PEVs based on the speed of generator turbines is proposed and tested on the New England 10-unit 39-bus power system. By regulating the power output of the PEVs we show that (1) speed and voltage fluctuations resulting from large disturbances can be significantly reduced up to 5 times, and (2) the critical clearing time can be extended by 20-40%. Overall, the PEVs control strategy makes the power grid more robust.",

To address these challenges, for the first time, this paper developed novel adaptive emergency control schemes using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), by leveraging the high-dimensional feature extraction and non-linear generalization capabilities of DRL for complex power systems. Furthermore, an open-source platform named RLGC has been designed for the first time to assist the development and benchmarking of DRL algorithms for power system control. Details of the platform and DRL-based emergency control schemes for generator dynamic braking and under-voltage load shedding are presented. Extensive case studies performed in both two-area four-machine system and IEEE 39-Bus system have demonstrated the excellent performance and robustness of the proposed schemes.",

The increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including renewable generation, flexible loads, and storage provides extraordinary opportunities for improvements in efficiency and sustainability. However, they can introduce new vulnerabilities in the form of cyberattacks, which can cause significant challenges in ensuring grid resilience. We propose a framework in this paper for achieving grid resilience through suitably coordinated assets including a network of Internet of Things (IoT) devices. A local electricity market is proposed to identify trustable assets and carry out this coordination. Situational Awareness (SA) of locally available DERs with the ability to inject power or reduce consumption is enabled by the market, together with a monitoring procedure for their trustability and commitment. With this SA, we show that a variety of cyberattacks can be mitigated using local trustable resources without stressing the bulk grid. Multiple demonstrations are carried out using a high-fidelity co-simulation platform, real-time hardware-in-the-loop validation, and a utility-friendly simulator.",

Neither online inertia nor the speed of the committed units is considered in the scheduling process. With the increasing injection of uncertain renewable energy sources, this practice is starting to fall short especially in island power systems, where the primary frequency response is already scarce, and any contingency leads to potentially poor frequency response. This paper introduces a data driven linear constraint to improve the post-fault frequency quality in island power systems. A coherent initial data-set is obtained by simulating the system frequency response of single outages. Then logistic regression is employed as a predictive analytic procedure to differentiate the acceptable and unacceptable incidents. To compare the conventional methods with the proposed approach and also to handle the uncertain nature of renewable energy generation, an adaptive robust unit commitment formulation is utilized. Results for the island power system of La Palma show that depending on the chosen cut-point on the logistic regression estimation the proposed method can improve the frequency response quality of the system while reducing the operation costs.",

In this paper, we propose a language for specifying grid operation control protocols from a global point of view. We show how such global specifications can be used to automatically generate local controllers of individual components, and that the distributed implementation yielded by such controllers operationally corresponds to the global specification.

In this context, the required power system flexibility needs to be allocated in other units that can include energy storage, demand management or providing reserve from renewables curtailing the output power. The present paper proposes the new concept of grid-forming load, which can be considered a totally flexible concept of demand. The concept is not only ensuring the load is supporting the grid stability by adapting the load to the overall system balancing, but also ensures that the load is actually contributing to form the grid and to provide synchronization power to the overall system. In this sense, the new concept allows running a system powered only by renewables operating at maximum power (or operator defined set-point) in grid-following mode, while the overall system control is ubicated in the demand side. This is an important change of paradigm as it considers that all the flexibility, synchronism and stability provision is on the demand side. This concept can applied either to isolated systems or also to future power systems, where millions of loads steer the power system while the renewables are operating at full power. The paper proposes the concept, suggests possible control implementations of the grid-forming load and analyses the concept in four simulation case studies.",

These high-impact low-probability (HILP) events often result in extended outages and loss of critical services, thus, severely affecting customers' safety. This calls for the need to ensure resilience in distribution networks by quickly restoring the critical services during a disaster. This paper presents an advanced feeder restoration method to restore critical loads using distributed energy resources (DERs). A resilient restoration approach is proposed that jointly maximizes the amount of restored critical loads and optimizes the restoration times by optimally allocating grid's available DER resources. The restoration problem is modeled as a mixed-integer linear program with the objective of maximizing the resilience to post-restoration failures while simultaneously satisfying grid's critical connectivity and operational constraints and ensuring a radial operation for a given open-loop feeder configuration. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach using IEEE 123-node feeder with 5 DERs supplying 11 critical loads and IEEE 906-bus feeder with 3 DERs supplying 17 critical loads. The impacts of DER availability and fuel reserve on restored networks are assessed and it is shown that the proposed approach is successfully able to restore a maximum number of critical loads using available DERs.",

The algorithm uses the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for density estimation of the node positions and generates a set of nodes with similar spatial distribution to the nodes in a given network. Then, it uses two procedures, which are inspired by the historical evolution of the grids, to connect the nodes. The algorithm has several tunable parameters that allow generating grids similar to any given grid. Particularly, we apply it to the Western Interconnection (WI) and to grids that operate under the SERC Reliability Corporation (SERC) and the Florida Reliability Coordinating Council (FRCC), and show that it generates grids with similar structural and spatial properties to these grids.

      "abstract": "Power grids normally operate at some stable operating condition where power supply and demand are balanced. In response to emergency situations, load shedding is a prevailing approach where local protective devices are activated to cut a suitable amount of load to quickly rebalance the supply demand and hopefully stabilize the system. This traditional emergency control results in interrupted service with severe economic damage to customers. Also, such control is usually less effective due to the lack of coordination among protective devices. In this paper, we propose a novel structural emergency control to render post-fault dynamics from the critical/emergency fault-cleared state to the stable equilibrium point. This is a new control paradigm that does not rely on any continuous measurement or load shedding, as in the classical setup. Instead, the grid is made stable by discretely relocating the equilibrium point and its stability region such that the system is consecutively attracted from the fault-cleared state back to the original equilibrium point. The proposed control is designed by solving linear and convex optimization problems, making it possibly scalable to large-scale power grids. Finally, this emergency control scheme can be implemented by exploiting transmission facilities available on the existing grids.",
