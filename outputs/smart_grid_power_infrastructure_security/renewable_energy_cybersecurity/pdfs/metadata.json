      "abstract": "Cyberattacks on smart inverters and distributed PV are becoming an imminent threat, because of the recent well-documented vulnerabilities and attack incidents. Particularly, the long lifespan of inverter devices, users' oblivion of cybersecurity compliance, and the lack of cyber regulatory frameworks exacerbate the prospect of cyberattacks on smart inverters. As a result, this raises a question -- \"do cyberattacks on smart inverters, if orchestrated on a large scale, pose a genuine threat of wide-scale instability to the power grid and energy market\"? This paper provides a realistic assessment on the plausibility and impacts of wide-scale power instability caused by cyberattacks on smart inverters. We conduct an in-depth study based on the electricity market data of Australia and the knowledge of practical contingency mechanisms. Our key findings reveal: (1) Despite the possibility of disruption to the grid by cyberattacks on smart inverters, the impact is only significant under careful planning and orchestration. (2) While the grid can assure certain power system security to survive inadvertent contingency events, it is insufficient to defend against savvy attackers who can orchestrate attacks in an adversarial manner. Our data analysis of Australia's electricity grid also reveals that a relatively low percentage of distributed PV would be sufficient to launch an impactful concerted attack on the grid. Our study casts insights on robust strategies for defending the grid in the presence of cyberattacks for places with high penetration of distributed PV.",

      "abstract": "With the decreasing cost of solar photovoltaics (PV) and battery storage systems, more and more prosumers appear in the distribution systems. Accompanying with it is the trend of using home energy management systems (HEMS). HEMS technologies can help the households to schedule their energy prosumption with aims such as reduced electricity bills or increased self-sufficiency. However, their economic-driven operation can affect the grid security. Therefore, it is paramount to design a framework that can accommodate the interests of the key stakeholders in distribution systems, namely the grid operators, aggregators, and prosumers. In this paper, a novel transactive energy based operational framework is proposed. On the upper level, aggregators will interact with distribution grid operators through transactive approach to ensure the grid interests are satisfied. If there are grid issues, the aggregator will interact with the prosumers through a designed price adder. The simulation results indicate that the proposed framework can effectively accommodate the prosumers operation in distribution systems while keeping the key stakeholders interests.",

Many countries have introduced various energy policy instruments, such as renewable energy certificates (RECs), to support the growth of RES. RECs are tradable non-tangible assets, which have a monetary value. Tracking and certification of the origin of an energy resource regardless of its type (e.g., a conventional power plant or RES) is a critical operation. In addition to the certification of origin, trading transactions are needed to be performed using a secure method. Energy industry participants need to secure the data and applications related to RECs. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) is a perfect framework that can support such REC functionalities. This paper addresses the cybersecurity aspects in REC trading using Blockchain and a distributed ledger technology, considering detailed cybersecurity perspectives.",

The penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) including roof-top solar panels, energy storage, electric vehicles, etc., enables the on-site generation of economically dispatchable power curtailing operational costs. The effective control of DERs requires communication between utilities and DER system operators. The communication protocols employed for DER management and control lack sophisticated cybersecurity features and can compromise power systems secure operation if malicious control commands are issued to DERs. To overcome authentication-related protocol issues, we present a bolt-on security extension that can be implemented on Distributed Network Protocol v3 (DNP3). We port an authentication framework, DERauth, into DNP3, and utilize real-time measurements from a simulated DER battery energy storage system to enhance communication security. We evaluate our framework in a testbed setup using DNP3 master and outstation devices performing secure authentication by leveraging the entropy of DERs.",

Using simulated data and a constellation of 15 inverters in a ring communication topology, the COLA algorithm is shown to accomplish the learning task required for voltage magnitude prediction with far less communication overhead than fully connected P2P learning protocols. Additionally, a dynamic stopping criterion is proposed that does not require a regularizer like the original COLA stopping criterion.",

Particularly, this paper focuses on stability, ancillary services, operation, and security of single and multiple inverters in the modern power grid. A grid-interactive inverter performs as a controllable interface between the distributed energy sources and the power grid. High-penetration of inverters in a power distribution system can create some technical challenges on the power quality, as well as voltage and frequency control of the system. In particular, a weak grid can lead to voltage oscillation and consequently instability. Moreover, the power grid is moving toward becoming a cyber-physical system in which smart inverters can exchange information for power marketing and economic dispatching. This puts the inverters at the risk of insecure operations. Hence, security enhancement has become another primary concern. Finally, the grid-interactive inverters are operated proportional power-sharing while operating together with many inverters. Recent research on coordinated operations is also discussed in this paper.",

      "abstract": "The digitization and decentralization of the electric power grid are key thrusts for an economically and environmentally sustainable future. Towards this goal, distributed energy resources (DER), including rooftop solar panels, battery storage, electric vehicles, etc., are becoming ubiquitous in power systems. Power utilities benefit from DERs as they minimize operational costs; at the same time, DERs grant users and aggregators control over the power they produce and consume. DERs are interconnected, interoperable, and support remotely controllable features, thus, their cybersecurity is of cardinal importance. DER communication dependencies and the diversity of DER architectures widen the threat surface and aggravate the cybersecurity posture of power systems. In this work, we focus on security oversights that reside in the cyber and physical layers of DERs and can jeopardize grid operations. Existing works have underlined the impact of cyberattacks targeting DER assets, however, they either focus on specific system components (e.g., communication protocols), do not consider the mission-critical objectives of DERs, or neglect the adversarial perspective (e.g., adversary/attack models) altogether. To address these omissions, we comprehensively analyze adversarial capabilities and objectives when manipulating DER assets, and then present how protocol and device-level vulnerabilities can materialize into cyberattacks impacting power system operations. Finally, we provide mitigation strategies to thwart adversaries and directions for future DER cybersecurity research.",

      "abstract": "The advent of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as distributed renewables, energy storage, electric vehicles, and controllable loads, \\rv{brings} a significantly disruptive and transformational impact on the centralized power system. It is widely accepted that a paradigm shift to a decentralized power system with bidirectional power flow is necessary to the integration of DERs. The virtual power plant (VPP) emerges as a promising paradigm for managing DERs to participate in the power system. In this paper, we develop a blockchain-based VPP energy management platform to facilitate a rich set of transactive energy activities among residential users with renewables, energy storage, and flexible loads in a VPP. Specifically, users can interact with each other to trade energy for mutual benefits and provide network services, such as feed-in energy, reserve, and demand response, through the VPP. To respect the users' independence and preserve their privacy, we design a decentralized optimization algorithm to optimize the users' energy scheduling, energy trading, and network services. Then we develop a prototype blockchain network for VPP energy management and implement the proposed algorithm on the blockchain network. By experiments using real-world data-trace, we validated the feasibility and effectiveness of our algorithm and the blockchain system. The simulation results demonstrate that our blockchain-based VPP energy management platform reduces the users' cost by up to 38.6% and reduces the overall system cost by 11.2%.",

      "abstract": "With the boom of renewable energy sources (RES), the number of power inverters proliferates. Power inverters are the key electronic devices that transform the direct current (DC) power from RES to the alternating current (AC) power on the grids, and their security can affect the stable operation of RES and even power grids. This paper analyzes the security of photovoltaic (PV) inverters from the aspects of internal sensors since they serve as the foundation for safe power conversion. We discover that both the embedded current sensors and voltage sensors are vulnerable to electromagnetic interference (EMI) of 1 GHz or higher, despite electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) countermeasures. Such vulnerabilities can lead to incorrect measurements and deceiving the control algorithms, and we design ReThink that could produce three types of consequences on PV inverters by emitting carefully crafted EMI, i.e., Denial of Service (DoS), damaging inverters physically or damping the power output. We successfully validate these consequences on 5 off-the-shelf PV inverters, and even in a real-world microgrid, by transmitting EMI signals at a distance of 100-150cm and a total power within 20W. Our work aims to raise awareness of the security of power electronic devices of RES, as they represent an emerging Cyber-Physical attack surface to the future RES-dominated grid. Finally, to cope with such threats, we provide hardware and software-based countermeasures.",

Our proposed solution integrates Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and the Web of Trust (WoT) concepts, promoting decentralized communication channels and robust key management. We further introduce a smart contract-based energy trading mechanism that factors in trust, distance, and energy type (green or non-green) in cost calculation. The utility and robustness of RETINA have been validated in a virtualized testbed environment with 500 nodes, demonstrating superior performance in terms of scalability and resilience compared to the existing WoT scheme. Furthermore, RETINA successfully enables a secure and efficient energy trading scheme, promoting the use of renewable energy sources. Future enhancements will include application to a realistic smart grid deployment and the integration of additional functionalities.

      "abstract": "In this paper, we aim to leverage peer to peer (P2P) transactive energy framework for optimal control of rooftop or neighborhood solar power with battery electric storage systems (BESS). Here we propose that the multiple neighboring customers would interconnect to form a community DC grid while still being connected to the main utility grid. The proposed infrastructure would (i) increase the resilience of the customers in case the utility grid becomes unavailable, (ii) reduce AC/DC conversion losses since a majority of the DER generation is in DC, and (iii) with the help of BESS, the customers will have a lesser impact on the utility grid in terms of California 'duck curve.' The exchange of resources and further utilization of economies of scale would significantly reduce the cost of this new infrastructure. Customers will be able to fall back on the utility AC grid in case of a cyber-attack on the community DC grid, improving cyber-security further. The proposed P2P transactive energy scheme is based on cooperation among the homeowners, using additional metering nodes to allow the sale or purchase of energy among residents. While it is expected that the scope will be limited to customers within a neighborhood, multiple neighborhoods can still interact via a utility AC grid. While it is likely that the P2P controller carrying out optimal control would work seamlessly, customers' interactions will be based on a zero-trust approach. As a part of this approach, multifactor authentication, role-based access control, etc., would be utilized, significantly improving overall cybersecurity. We examine these three strategies as case studies: (i) single home with solar power, (ii) single home with Solar power and BESS, and (iii) two or more homes with solar power and community energy storage to facilitate the policymakers making the recommendation.",

First, the production is shifting from classical energy sources such as coal and nuclear power towards renewable resources such as solar and wind. Secondly, the consumption in the low voltage grid is expected to grow significantly due to expected introduction of electrical vehicles. The first step towards more efficient operational capabilities is to introduce an observability of the distribution system and allow for leveraging the flexibility of end connection points with manageable consumption, generation and storage capabilities. Thanks to the advanced measurement devices, management framework, and secure communication infrastructure developed in the FP7 SUNSEED project, the Distribution System Operator (DSO) now has full observability of the energy flows at the medium/low voltage grid. Furthermore, the prosumers are able to participate pro-actively and coordinate with the DSO and other stakeholders in the grid. The monitoring and management functionalities have strong requirements to the communication latency, reliability and security. This paper presents novel solutions and analyses of these aspects for the SUNSEED scenario, where the smart grid ICT solutions are provided through shared cellular LTE networks.",

Within a transactive microgrid, \"prosumers\" (i.e., consumers with energy generation and storage capabilities) can trade energy with each other, thereby smoothing the load on the main grid using local supply. It is hard, however, to provide security, safety, and privacy in a decentralized and transactive energy system. On the one hand, prosumers' personal information must be protected from their trade partners and the system operator. On the other hand, the system must be protected from careless or malicious trading, which could destabilize the entire grid. This paper describes Privacy-preserving Energy Transactions (PETra), which is a secure and safe solution for transactive microgrids that enables consumers to trade energy without sacrificing their privacy. PETra builds on distributed ledgers, such as blockchains, and provides anonymity for communication, bidding, and trading.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a multi-stage expansion model for the co-planning of transmission lines, battery energy storage (ES), and wind power plants (WPP). High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) is integrated into the proposed model concerning renewable portfolio standard (RPS) policy goals. The possibility of bundling existing transmission lines to uprate power flow capacity is considered. Renewable energy curtailment and load shedding are included in the model to assess the system operation more precisely. Battery ES devices are co-planned to defer transmission expansion and renewable management. To make the time complexity of the problem tractable and capture the uncertainties of load and RES in an hourly resolution, a chronological time-period clustering algorithm is used to extract the representative hours of each planning stage. Additionally, the flexible ramp reserve is utilized to handle the uncertainty of RES. An accelerated Benders dual decomposition (BDD) algorithm is developed to solve the proposed model mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation. The N-1 security criterion is evaluated by considering a designed contingency screening (CS) algorithm to identify higher risk contingencies. The effectiveness of the proposed co-planning model is evaluated using IEEE RTS 24-bus and IEEE 118-bus test systems.",

This paper proposes a secure market protocol using innovations from distributed optimization and Secure MultiParty Computation (SMPC). The considered LEM is formulated as an uncertainty-aware joint market for energy and reserves with affine balancing policies. To achieve scalability and enable the use of SMPC, market clearing is solved using the Consensus ADMM algorithm. Subsequently, the data exchange among participants via ADMM iterations is protected using the Shamir secret-sharing scheme to ensure privacy. The market protocol is further reinforced by a secure and verifiable settlement process that uses SMPC and ElGamal commitments to verify market quantities and by a secure recovery scheme for missing network measurements. Finally, the feasibility and performance of the proposed LEM are evaluated on a 15-bus test network.",

This shift to the smart grid concept involves, among others, the utilization of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar panels and storage systems, contributing towards grid decentralization while improving control over power generation. In order to seamlessly integrate DERs into power systems, embedded devices are used to support the communication and control functions of DERs. As a result, vulnerabilities of such components can be ported to the industrial environment. Insecure control networks and protocols further exacerbate the problem. Towards reducing the attack surface, we present an authentication scheme for DERs, DERauth, which leverages the inherent entropy of the DER battery energy storage system (BESS) as a root-of-trust. The DER authentication is achieved using a challenge-reply mechanism that relies on the corresponding DER's BESS state-of-charge (SoC) and voltage measurements. A dynamically updating process ensures that the BESS state is up-to-date. We evaluate our proof-of-concept in a prototype development that uses lithium-ion (li-ion) batteries for the BESS. The robustness of our design is assessed against modeling attacks performed by neural networks.",

Smart Grid 2.0 (SG2) is expected to explore data-driven analytics and enhance communication technologies to improve the efficiency and sustainability of distributed renewable energy systems. These features are beyond smart metering and electric surplus distribution in conventional smart grids. Given the high dependence on communication networks to connect distributed microgrids in SG2, potential cascading failures of connectivity can cause disruption to data synchronization to the remote control systems. This paper reviews security threats and defense tactics for three stakeholders: power grid operators, communication network providers, and consumers. Through the survey, we found that SG2's stakeholders are particularly vulnerable to substation attacks/vandalism, malware/ransomware threats, blockchain vulnerabilities and supply chain breakdowns. Furthermore, incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into autonomous energy management in distributed energy resources of SG2 creates new challenges. Accordingly, adversarial samples and false data injection on electricity reading and measurement sensors at power plants can fool AI-powered control functions and cause messy error-checking operations in energy storage, wrong energy estimation in electric vehicle charging, and even fraudulent transactions in peer-to-peer energy trading models. Scalable blockchain-based models, physical unclonable function, interoperable security protocols, and trustworthy AI models designed for managing distributed microgrids in SG2 are typical promising protection models for future research.",

      "abstract": "Increasing volatilities within power transmission and distribution force power grid operators to amplify their use of communication infrastructure to monitor and control their grid. The resulting increase in communication creates a larger attack surface for malicious actors. Indeed, cyber attacks on power grids have already succeeded in causing temporary, large-scale blackouts in the recent past. In this paper, we analyze the communication infrastructure of power grids to derive resulting fundamental challenges of power grids with respect to cybersecurity. Based on these challenges, we identify a broad set of resulting attack vectors and attack scenarios that threaten the security of power grids. To address these challenges, we propose to rely on a defense-in-depth strategy, which encompasses measures for (i) device and application security, (ii) network security, (iii) physical security, as well as (iv) policies, procedures, and awareness. For each of these categories, we distill and discuss a comprehensive set of state-of-the art approaches, and identify further opportunities to strengthen cybersecurity in interconnected power grids.",

ML models have become increasingly important in predicting renewable energy generation and consumption, utilizing various techniques like artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees. Furthermore, data preprocessing methods, such as data splitting, normalization, decomposition, and discretization, are employed to enhance prediction accuracy.   The incorporation of big data and ML into smart grids offers several advantages, including heightened energy efficiency, more effective responses to demand, and better integration of renewable energy sources.

Attacks originating from the distributed edge devices of DER system, such as photovoltaic (PV) system, is often difficult to detect. An attacker may change the control configurations or various setpoints of the PV inverters to destabilize the power grid, damage devices, or for the purpose of economic gain. A more powerful attacker may even manipulate the PV system metering data transmitted for remote monitoring, so that (s)he can remain hidden. In this paper, we consider a case where PV systems operating in different control modes can be simultaneously attacked and the attacker has the ability to manipulate individual PV bus measurements to avoid detection. We show that even in such a scenario, with just the aggregated measurements (that the attacker cannot manipulate), machine learning (ML) techniques are able to detect the attack in a fast and accurate manner. We use a standard radial distribution network, together with real smart home electricity consumption data and solar power data in our experimental setup. We test the performance of several ML algorithms to detect attacks on the PV system. Our detailed evaluations show that the proposed intrusion detection system (IDS) is highly effective and efficient in detecting attacks on PV inverter control modes.",

VPPs are supposed to carry out intelligent, secure, and smart energy trading among prosumers, buyers, and generating stations along with providing efficient energy management. Therefore, integrating blockchain in a decentralized VPP network emerged as a new paradigm, and recent experiments over this integration have shown fruitful results. However, this decentralization also suffers with energy management, trust, reliability, and efficiency issues due to the dynamic nature of DERs. In order to overcome this, in this paper, we first work over providing an efficient energy management strategy for VPP to enhance demand response, then we propose an energy oriented trading and block mining protocol and name it as proof of energy market (PoEM). To enhance it further, we integrate differential privacy in PoEM and propose a Private PoEM (PPoEM) model. Collectively, we propose a private decentralized VPP trading model and named it as Virtual Private Trading (VPT) model. We further carry out extensive theoretical analysis and derive step-by-step valuations for market race probability, market stability probability, energy trading expectation, winning state probability, and prospective leading time profit values. Afterwards, we carry out simulation-based experiments of our proposed model. The performance evaluation and theoretical analysis of our VPT model make it one of the most viable models for blockchain based VPP networks as compared to other state-of-the-art works.",

Australia is experiencing this shift now - from having the third most carbon-intensive electricity sector in the world in 2010, to now having penetrations of variable renewable energy (VRE) regularly reaching 100 percent in some regions, with world-leading uptake of distributed energy resources (DER). This paper presents pioneering work exploring new technical, economic and regulatory frameworks for the provision of Essential System Services (ESS), also known as ancillary services, in power systems dominated by variable inverter-based renewable energy resources. We explore the recent application of the concept of demand curves and nomograms to the procurement of ESS, and emerging design principles for frameworks in facilitating the evolution from default provision of system services by synchronous generation, to co-optimisation of services through unit commitment, to independent provision of services through inverter based resources. The paper also analyses the recent technical and financial success of the world's largest battery, the Hornsdale Power Reserve in South Australia, and its ability to inform how future electricity market frameworks may incentivize and accommodate new technological capability, both first and Nth of a kind systems. Finally, the paper reviews emerging energy system technological capability, including the provision of synthetic inertia and RoCoF control, grid-forming inverters, and advanced DER aggregation in providing ESS and system restart capability for secure, resilient and island-able grids.",

The energy sector is going through substantial changes fueled by two key drivers: building a zero-carbon energy sector and the digital transformation of the energy infrastructure. We expect to see the convergence of these two drivers resulting in the IoE, where renewable distributed energy resources (DERs), such as electric cars, storage batteries, wind turbines and photovoltaics (PV), can be connected and integrated for reliable energy distribution by leveraging advanced 5G-6G networks and AI technology. This allows DER owners as prosumers to participate in the energy market and derive economic incentives. DERs are inherently asset-driven and face equitable challenges (i.e., fair, diverse and inclusive). Without equitable access, privileged individuals, groups and organizations can participate and benefit at the cost of disadvantaged groups. The real-time management of DER resources not only brings out the equity problem to the IoE, it also collects highly sensitive location, time, activity dependent data, which requires to be handled responsibly (e.g., privacy, security and safety), for AI-enhanced predictions, optimization and prioritization services, and automated management of flexible resources. The vision of our project is to ensure equitable participation of the community members and responsible use of their data in IoE so that it could reap the benefits of advances in AI to provide safe, reliable and sustainable energy services.",

While the inclusion of intermittent RES coupled with the wide-scale deployment of communication and sensing devices is important towards a fully smart grid, it has also expanded the cyber-threat landscape, effectively making power systems vulnerable to cyberattacks. This paper proposes a cybersecurity assessment approach designed to assess the cyberphysical security of EPS. The work takes into consideration the intermittent generation of RES, vulnerabilities introduced by microprocessor-based electronic information and operational technology (IT/OT) devices, and contingency analysis results. The proposed approach utilizes deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and an adapted Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score tailored to assess vulnerabilities in EPS in order to identify the optimal attack transition policy based on N-2 contingency results, i.e., the simultaneous failure of two system elements. The effectiveness of the work is validated via numerical and real-time simulation experiments performed on literature-based power grid test cases. The results demonstrate how the proposed method based on deep Q-network (DQN) performs closely to a graph-search approach in terms of the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack policy, without the need for full observation of the system. In addition, the experiments present the method's scalability by showcasing the number of transitions needed to find the optimal attack transition policy in a large system such as the Polish 2383 bus test system. The results exhibit how the proposed approach requires one order of magnitude fewer transitions when compared to a random transition policy.",

An alternative to retain high dispatchable generation capacity is electric energy storage that enables utilization of surplus power, where the electric energy storage contributes to the security of supply. Such systems can be considered as energy-constrained, and the operation of the electric energy storage must balance operating cost minimization and the risk of scarcity. In this matter, operation dependent storage characteristics such as energy storage degradation are a complicating factor. This paper proposes a linear approximation of battery state-of-charge degradation and implements it in a stochastic dual dynamic programming based energy-management model in combination with cycling degradation. The implications of degradation modelling are studied for a small Norwegian microgrid with variable renewable power generation and limited dispatchable generation capacity as well as battery and hydrogen storage to balance supply and demand. Our results show that the proposed strategy can prolong the expected battery lifetime by more than four years compared to the naive stochastic strategy but may cause increased degradation for other system resources. It is also evident that a stochastic strategy is crucial to retain low risk of scarcity in energy-constrained systems.",

      "abstract": "The increasing demand for direct electric energy in the grid is also tied to the increase of Electric Vehicle (EV) usage in the cities, which eventually will totally substitute combustion engine Vehicles. Nevertheless, this high amount of energy required, which is stored in the EV batteries, is not always used and it can constitute a virtual power plant on its own. Bidirectional EVs equipped with batteries connected to the grid can therefore charge or discharge energy depending on public needs, producing a smart shift of energy where and when needed. EVs employed as mobile storage devices can add resilience and supply/demand balance benefits to specific loads, in many cases as part of a Microgrid (MG). Depending on the direction of the energy transfer, EVs can provide backup power to households through vehicle-to-house (V2H) charging, or storing unused renewable power through renewable-to-vehicle (RE2V) charging. V2H and RE2V solutions can complement renewable power sources like solar photovoltaic (PV) panels and wind turbines (WT), which fluctuate over time, increasing the self-consumption and autarky. The concept of distributed energy resources (DERs) is becoming more and more present and requires new solutions for the integration of multiple complementary resources with variable supply over time. The development of these ideas is coupled with the growth of new AI techniques that will potentially be the managing core of such systems. Machine learning techniques can model the energy grid environment in such a flexible way that constant optimization is possible. This fascinating working principle introduces the wider concept of an interconnected, shared, decentralized grid of energy. This research on Reinforcement Learning control strategies for Electric Vehicles and Renewable energy sources Virtual Power Plants focuses on providing solutions for such energy supply optimization models.",

      "abstract": "The increasing adoption of renewable energy sources increases the need for balancing power. The security concerns of the distribution system operators are increasing due to fast adoption of distributed energy resources. So far, various operational models are proposed to manage the distributed energy resources for economic benefit. However, there is lack of an efficient operational model that balances the security, market, and uncertainty management. With the focus on the aggregators operation, this paper developed an operational model for continuous operation of aggregators interactively with the grid operators. A rolling optimization model is developed to manage the uncertainties from prediction errors. The network security is ensured continuously through an iterative price negotiation process between the distribution network operator and the aggregators. The optimality of the solution is guaranteed by convexification of the mixed integer formulation.",

      "abstract": "Recently, harvesting natural energy is gaining more attention than other conventional approaches for sustainable Internet-of-Things (IoT). System on chip (SoC) power requirement for the IoT and generating higher voltages on-chip is a massive challenge for on-chip peripherals and systems. Many sensors are employed in smart cities and smart villages in decision-making, whose power requirement is an issue, and it must be uninterrupted. Previously, we presented Security-by-Design (SbD) principle to bring energy dissipation and cybersecurity together through our \"Eternal-Thing\". In this paper, an on-chip reliable energy harvesting system (EHS) is designed for IoT end node devices which is called \"Eternal-Thing 2.0\". The management section monitors the process load and also the recharging of the battery or super-capacitor. An efficient maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm is used to avoid quiescent power consumption. The reliability of the proposed EHS is improved by using an aging tolerant ring oscillator. The proposed EHS is intended and simulated in CMOS 90nm technology. The output voltage is within the vary of 3-3.55V with an input of 1-1.5V. The EHS consumes 22 micro Watt of power, that satisfies the ultra-low-power necessities of IoT sensible nodes.",
