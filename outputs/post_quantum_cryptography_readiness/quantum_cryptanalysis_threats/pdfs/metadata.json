      "abstract": "Quantum algorithms can break factoring and discrete logarithm based cryptography and weaken symmetric cryptography and hash functions. In order to estimate the real-world impact of these attacks, apart from tracking the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers it is important to have an estimate of the resources needed to implement these quantum attacks.   For attacking symmetric cryptography and hash functions, generic quantum attacks are substantially less powerful than they are for today's public-key cryptography. So security will degrade gradually as quantum computing resources increase. At present, there is a substantial resource overhead due to the cost of fault-tolerant quantum error correction. We provide estimates of this overhead using state-of-the-art methods in quantum fault-tolerance. We use state-of-the-art optimized circuits, though further improvements in their implementation would also reduce the resources needed to implement these attacks. To bound the potential impact of further circuit optimizations we provide cost estimates assuming trivial-cost implementations of these functions. These figures indicate the effective bit-strength of the various symmetric schemes and hash functions based on what we know today (and with various assumptions on the quantum hardware), and frame the various potential improvements that should continue to be tracked. As an example, we also look at the implications for Bitcoin's proof-of-work system.   For many of the currently used asymmetric (public-key) cryptographic schemes based on RSA and elliptic curve discrete logarithms, we again provide cost estimates based on the latest advances in cryptanalysis, circuit compilation and quantum fault-tolerance theory. These allow, for example, a direct comparison of the quantum vulnerability of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography for a fixed classical bit strength.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers has important consequences for cryptographic algorithms. It is theoretically well-established that key algorithms used in cybersecurity are vulnerable to quantum computers due to the fact that theoretical security guarantees, designed based on algorithmic complexity for classical computers, are not sufficient for quantum circuits. Many different quantum algorithms have been developed, which have potentially broad applications on future computing systems. However, this potential depends on the continued maturation of quantum hardware, which remains an area of active research and development. Theoretical limits provide an upper bound on the performance for algorithms. In practice, threats to encryption can only be accurately be assessed in the context of the rapidly evolving hardware and software landscape. Software co-design refers to the concurrent design of software and hardware as a way to understand the limitations of current capabilities and develop effective strategies to advance the state of the art. Since the capabilities for classical computation currently exceed quantum capabilities, quantum emulation techniques can play an important role in the co-design process. In this paper, we describe how the {\\em cuQuantum} environment can support quantum algorithm co-design activities using widely-available commodity hardware. We describe how emulation techniques can be used to assess the impact of noise on algorithms of interest, and identify limitations associated with current hardware. We present our analysis in the context of areas of priority for cybersecurity and cryptography in particular since these algorithms are extraordinarily consequential for securing information in the digital world.",

We implement simulations of our attacks for symmetric-key protocols such as S-DES, S-AES and Blowfish. For instance, we show how our attack allows a classical simulation of a small 8-qubit quantum computer to find the secret key of one 32-bit Blowfish instance with 24 times fewer number of iterations than a brute-force attack. Our work also shows improvements in attack success rates for lightweight ciphers such as S-DES and S-AES. Further applications beyond symmetric-key cryptography are also discussed, including asymmetric-key protocols and hash functions.

This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis between classical cryptographic algorithms currently in widespread use and emerging post-quantum cryptographic schemes designed to withstand quantum adversaries. We review the cryptographic mechanisms underpinning modern internet security, outline the mathematical foundations of quantum attacks, and evaluate the security, performance, and implementation feasibility of quantum-resistant alternatives such as Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. Additionally, we assess the hybrid approaches currently being explored by institutions and tech companies to enable a smooth transition to post-quantum cryptography.

      "authors": [
        "Mohamed Aly Bouke"
      ],
      "abstract": "Classical cryptographic systems rely heavily on structured algebraic problems, such as factorization, discrete logarithms, or lattice-based assumptions, which are increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks and structural cryptanalysis. In response, this work introduces the Hashed Fractal Key Recovery (HFKR) problem, a non-algebraic cryptographic construction grounded in symbolic dynamics and chaotic perturbations. HFKR builds on the Symbolic Path Inversion Problem (SPIP), leveraging symbolic trajectories generated via contractive affine maps over $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, and compressing them into fixed-length cryptographic keys using hash-based obfuscation. A key contribution of this paper is the empirical confirmation that these symbolic paths exhibit fractal behavior, quantified via box counting dimension, path geometry, and spatial density measures. The observed fractal dimension increases with trajectory length and stabilizes near 1.06, indicating symbolic self-similarity and space-filling complexity, both of which reinforce the entropy foundation of the scheme. Experimental results across 250 perturbation trials show that SHA3-512 and SHAKE256 amplify symbolic divergence effectively, achieving mean Hamming distances near 255, ideal bit-flip rates, and negligible entropy deviation. In contrast, BLAKE3 exhibits statistically uniform but weaker diffusion. These findings confirm that HFKR post-quantum security arises from the synergy between symbolic fractality and hash-based entropy amplification. The resulting construction offers a lightweight, structure-free foundation for secure key generation in adversarial settings without relying on algebraic hardness assumptions.",

      "abstract": "The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community.   On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of \"cryptographic agility\".",

      "abstract": "Quantum computers, that may become available one day, would impact many scientific fields, most notably cryptography since many asymmetric primitives are insecure against an adversary with quantum capabilities. Cryptographers are already anticipating this threat by proposing and studying a number of potentially quantum-safe alternatives for those primitives. On the other hand, symmetric primitives seem less vulnerable against quantum computing: the main known applicable result is Grover's algorithm that gives a quadratic speed-up for exhaustive search.   In this work, we examine more closely the security of symmetric ciphers against quantum attacks. Since our trust in symmetric ciphers relies mostly on their ability to resist cryptanalysis techniques, we investigate quantum cryptanalysis techniques. More specifically, we consider quantum versions of differential and linear cryptanalysis. We show that it is usually possible to use quantum computations to obtain a quadratic speed-up for these attack techniques, but the situation must be nuanced: we don't get a quadratic speed-up for all variants of the attacks. This allows us to demonstrate the following non-intuitive result: the best attack in the classical world does not necessarily lead to the best quantum one. We give some examples of application on ciphers LAC and KLEIN. We also discuss the important difference between an adversary that can only perform quantum computations, and an adversary that can also make quantum queries to a keyed primitive.",

Using a quantum oracle to the hash, we can reconstruct the kernel of the hash function, which is enough to find collisions and second preimages.

Furthermore, we describe applications of algorithms for computing short discrete logarithms. In particular, we show how other important problems such as those of factoring RSA integers and of finding the order of groups under side information may be recast as short discrete logarithm problems. This immediately gives rise to an algorithm for factoring RSA integers that is less complex than Shor's general factoring algorithm in the sense that it imposes smaller requirements on the quantum computer.   In both our algorithm and Shor's algorithm, the main hurdle is to compute a modular exponentiation in superposition. When factoring an n bit integer, the exponent is of length 2n bits in Shor's algorithm, compared to slightly more than n/2 bits in our algorithm.",

We propose a security risk assessment framework that examines vulnerabilities across algorithms, certificates, and protocols throughout the migration process (pre-migration, during migration, post-migration). We link these vulnerabilities to the STRIDE threat model to assess their impact and likelihood. Then, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for critical components like algorithms, public key infrastructures, and protocols. Our study not only identifies potential attacks and vulnerabilities at each layer and migration stage but also suggests possible countermeasures and alternatives to enhance system resilience, empowering organizations to construct a secure infrastructure for the quantum era.

Encoding the work register in higher-dimensional states, we implement a two-photon compiled algorithm to factor N=21. The algorithmic output is distinguishable from noise, in contrast to previous demonstrations. These results point to larger-scale implementations of Shor's algorithm by harnessing scalable resource reductions applicable to all physical architectures.",

The estimates are derived from a simulation of a Toffoli gate network for controlled elliptic curve point addition, implemented within the framework of the quantum computing software tool suite LIQ$Ui|\\rangle$. We determine circuit implementations for reversible modular arithmetic, including modular addition, multiplication and inversion, as well as reversible elliptic curve point addition. We conclude that elliptic curve discrete logarithms on an elliptic curve defined over an $n$-bit prime field can be computed on a quantum computer with at most $9n + 2\\lceil\\log_2(n)\\rceil+10$ qubits using a quantum circuit of at most $448 n^3 \\log_2(n) + 4090 n^3$ Toffoli gates. We are able to classically simulate the Toffoli networks corresponding to the controlled elliptic curve point addition as the core piece of Shor's algorithm for the NIST standard curves P-192, P-224, P-256, P-384 and P-521. Our approach allows gate-level comparisons to recent resource estimates for Shor's factoring algorithm. The results also support estimates given earlier by Proos and Zalka and indicate that, for current parameters at comparable classical security levels, the number of qubits required to tackle elliptic curves is less than for attacking RSA, suggesting that indeed ECC is an easier target than RSA.",

Although the proposal of the extended Shor's algorithm offers hope for cracking ECDLP, it is debatable whether the algorithm can actually pose a threat in practice. From the perspective of the quantum circuit of the algorithm, we analyze the feasibility of cracking ECDLP with improved quantum circuits using an ion trap quantum computer.   We give precise quantum circuits for extended Shor's algorithm to calculate discrete logarithms on elliptic curves over prime fields, including modulus subtraction, three different modulus multiplication, modulus inverse, and windowed arithmetic. Whereas previous studies mostly focused on minimizing the number of qubits or the depth of the circuit, we minimize the number of CNOTs, which greatly affects the time to run the algorithm on an ion trap quantum computer. First, we give the implementation of the basic arithmetic with the lowest known number of CNOTs and the construction of an improved modular inverse, point addition, and the windowing technique. Then, we precisely estimate the number of improved quantum circuits needed to perform the extended Shor's algorithm for factoring an n-bit integer. We analyze the running time and feasibility of the extended Shor's algorithm on an ion trap quantum computer according to the number of CNOTs. Finally, we discussed the lower bound of the number of CNOTs needed to implement the extended Shor's algorithm.",

Unlike regular computers, which are often deemed cost-ineffective in cryptographic attacks, quantum computers have a significant advantage in calculation speed. This distinction potentially makes currently used algorithms less secure or even completely vulnerable, compelling the exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as the most reasonable solution to quantum threats. This review aims to provide current information on applications, benefits, and challenges associated with the PQC. The review employs a systematic scoping review with the scope restricted to the years 2022 and 2023; only articles that were published in scientific journals were used in this paper. The review examined the articles on the applications of quantum computing in various spheres. However, the scope of this paper was restricted to the domain of the PQC because most of the analyzed articles featured this field. Subsequently, the paper is analyzing various PQC algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial, and isogeny-based cryptography. Each algorithm is being judged based on its potential applications, robustness, and challenges. All the analyzed algorithms are promising for the post-quantum era in such applications as digital signatures, communication channels, and IoT. Moreover, some of the algorithms are already implemented in the spheres of banking transactions, communication, and intellectual property. Meanwhile, despite their potential, these algorithms face serious challenges since they lack standardization, require vast amounts of storage and computation power, and might have unknown vulnerabilities that can be discovered only with years of cryptanalysis.",

Due to the super-exponential size $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2^n})$ of the associated space, finding $n$-variable Boolean functions with global cryptographic constraints is computationally hard. This problem has already been addressed employing generic low-connected incoherent D-Wave quantum annealers.

Here, we propose a special-purpose coherent quantum annealing architecture with three couplers per qubit, designed to optimally encode the bent function design problem. A coherent quantum annealer with this tree-type architecture has the potential to solve the $8$-variable bent function design problem, which is classically unsolved, with only $127$ physical qubits and $126$ couplers.

Here we present $1 \\rightarrow 2$ and $1 \\rightarrow 3$ quantum telecloning circuits, with and without ancilla, that are theoretically optimal (meaning the clones have the highest fidelity allowed by quantum mechanics), universal (meaning the clone fidelity is independent of the state being cloned), and symmetric (meaning the clones all have the same fidelity). We implement these circuits on gate model IBMQ and Quantinuum NISQ hardware and quantify the clone fidelities using parallel single qubit state tomography. Quantum telecloning using mid-circuit measurement with classical feed-forward control (i.e. real time if statements) is demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-2 device. Two alternative implementations of quantum telecloning, deferred measurement and post selection, are demonstrated on ibmq\\_montreal, where mid-circuit measurements with real time if statements are not available. Our results show that NISQ devices can achieve near-optimal quantum telecloning fidelity; for example the Quantinuum H1-2 device running the telecloning circuits without ancilla achieved a mean clone fidelity of $0.824$ with standard deviation of $0.024$ for two clone circuits and $0.765$ with standard deviation of $0.022$ for three clone circuits.

With the recent advent of quantum computing, the security of current blockchain cryptosystems can be compromised to a greater extent. Quantum algorithms like Shor's large integer factorization algorithm and Grover's unstructured database search algorithm can provide exponential and quadratic speedup, respectively, in contrast to their classical counterpart. This can put threats on both public-key cryptosystems and hash functions, which necessarily demands to migrate from classical cryptography to quantum-secure cryptography.

For such purpose, this article first studies current and future classical state-of-the-art blockchain scalability and security primitives. The relevant quantum-safe blockchain cryptosystem initiatives which have been taken by Bitcoin, Ethereum, Corda, etc. are stated and compared with respect to key sizes, hash length, execution time, computational overhead, and energy efficiency.

By analyzing control and data flow the tool is able to build an extendable and querriable inventory of cryptography. Cryptoscope goes beyond identifying disconnected cryptographic APIs and instead provides the user with an inventory of cryptographic assets - containing comprehensive views of the cryptographic operations implemented. We show that for more than 92% of our test cases, these views include the cryptographic operation itself, APIs, as well as the related material such as keys, nonces, random sources etc. Lastly, building on top of this inventory, our tool is able to detect and report all the cryptographic related weaknesses and vulnerabilities (11 out of 15) in CamBench - achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

Shor's algorithm poses a significant threat to RSA and ECC, while Grover's algorithm reduces the security of symmetric encryption schemes, such as AES. The objective of this paper is to underscore the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to mitigate these risks in TCPS by analyzing the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic schemes and the applicability of standardized PQC schemes in TCPS. We analyzed vulnerabilities in traditional cryptography against quantum attacks and reviewed the applicability of NIST-standardized PQC schemes, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and SPHINCS+, in TCPS. We conducted a case study to analyze the vulnerabilities of a TCPS application from the Architecture Reference for Cooperative and Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT) service package, i.e., Electronic Toll Collection, leveraging the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool. This case study highlights the cryptographic vulnerabilities of a TCPS application and presents how PQC can effectively counter these threats. Additionally, we evaluated CRYSTALS-Kyber's performance across wired and wireless TCPS data communication scenarios. While CRYSTALS-Kyber proves effective in securing TCPS applications over high-bandwidth, low-latency Ethernet networks, our analysis highlights challenges in meeting the stringent latency requirements of safety-critical wireless applications within TCPS. Future research should focus on developing lightweight PQC solutions and hybrid schemes that integrate traditional and PQC algorithms, to enhance compatibility, scalability, and real-time performance, ensuring robust protection against emerging quantum threats in TCPS.",

Traditional cryptographic algorithms, foundational to digital signatures, message encryption, and hashing functions, become vulnerable to the immense computational power of quantum computers. This paper conducts a thorough risk assessment of transitioning to quantum-resistant blockchains, comprehensively analyzing potential threats targeting vital blockchain components: the network, mining pools, transaction verification mechanisms, smart contracts, and user wallets. By elucidating the intricate challenges and strategic considerations inherent in transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms, the paper evaluates risks and highlights obstacles in securing blockchain components with quantum-resistant cryptography. It offers a hybrid migration strategy to facilitate a smooth transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. The analysis extends to prominent blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash, assessing vulnerable components, potential impacts, and associated STRIDE threats, thereby identifying areas susceptible to quantum attacks. Beyond analysis, the paper provides actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient blockchain ecosystems in the quantum computing era. Recognizing the looming threat of quantum computers, this research advocates for a proactive transition to quantum-resistant blockchain networks. It proposes a tailored security blueprint that strategically fortifies each component against the evolving landscape of quantum-induced cyber threats.

      "abstract": "Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a severe threat for public key cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless possible to build secure cryptosystems in it.   We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires $\\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the quantum model.   We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are secure with a quantum-secure PRF.   Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks, leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model.",

While many currently used public-key cryptosystems would be broken by Shor's algorithm, the effect of quantum computing on symmetric ones is still unclear. The security of symmetric ciphers relies heavily on the development of cryptanalytic tools. Thus, in order to accurately evaluate the security of symmetric primitives in the post-quantum world, it is significant to improve classical cryptanalytic methods using quantum algorithms. In this paper, we focus on two variants of differential cryptanalysis: truncated differential cryptanalysis and impossible differential cryptanalysis. Based on the fact that Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can be used to find the linear structures of Boolean functions, we propose two quantum algorithms that can be used to find high-probability truncated differentials and impossible differentials of block ciphers, respectively. We rigorously prove the validity of the algorithms and analyze their complexity. Our algorithms treat all rounds of the reduced cipher as a whole and only concerns the input and output differences at its both ends, instead of specific differential characteristics. Therefore, to a certain extent, they alleviate the weakness of conventional differential cryptanalysis, namely the difficulties in finding differential characteristics as the number of rounds increases.",

But the practical implications of these attacks remain blurry. In contrast, the results obtained so far for a quantum adversary making classical queries only are less impressive. In this paper, we introduce a new quantum algorithm which uses Simon's subroutines in a novel way. We manage to leverage the algebraic structure of cryptosystems in the context of a quantum attacker limited to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We obtain improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs with respect to the current literature, while using only as much hardware requirements (quantum and classical) as a standard exhaustive search with Grover's algorithm. In particular, we are able to break the Even-Mansour construction in quantum time $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits only. In addition, we improve some previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the same time complexity. Our approach can be seen in two complementary ways: \\emph{reusing} superposition queries during the iteration of a search using Grover's algorithm, or alternatively, removing the memory requirement in some quantum attacks based on a collision search, thanks to their algebraic structure. We provide a list of cryptographic applications, including the Even-Mansour construction, the FX construction, some Sponge authenticated modes of encryption, and many more.",

Motivated by current rapid experimental progress on quantum computing devices, various models of quantum computation have been investigated to show quantum computational supremacy. At a commercial side, quantum annealing machine realizes the quantum Ising model with a transverse field and heuristically solves combinatorial optimization problems. The computational power of this machine is closely related to adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) with a restricted type of Hamiltonians, namely stoquastic Hamiltonians, and has been thought to be relatively less powerful compared to universal quantum computers. Little is known about computational quantum speedup nor advantage in AQC with stoquastic Hamiltonians. Here we characterize computational capability of AQC with stoquastic Hamiltonians, which we call stoqAQC. We construct a concrete stoqAQC model, whose lowest energy gap is lower bounded polynomially, and hence the final state can be obtained in polynomial time. Then we show that it can simulate universal quantum computation if adaptive single-qubit measurements in non-standard bases are allowed on the final state. Even if the measurements are restricted to non-adaptive measurements to respect the robustness of AQC, the proposed model exhibits quantum computational supremacy; classical simulation is impossible under complexity theoretical conjectures. Moreover, it is found that such a stoqAQC model can simulate Shor's algorithm and solve the factoring problem in polynomial time. We also propose how to overcome the measurement imperfections via quantum error correction within the stoqAQC model and also an experimentally feasible verification scheme to test whether or not stoqAQC is done faithfully.",
