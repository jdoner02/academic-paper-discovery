      "abstract": "The emergence of quantum computers poses a significant threat to current secure service, application and/or protocol implementations that rely on RSA and ECDSA algorithms, for instance DNSSEC, because public-key cryptography based on number factorization or discrete logarithm is vulnerable to quantum attacks. This paper presents the integration of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) algorithms into CoreDNS to enable quantum-resistant DNSSEC functionality. We have developed a plugin that extends CoreDNS with support for five PQC signature algorithm families: ML-DSA, FALCON, SPHINCS+, MAYO, and SNOVA. Our implementation maintains compatibility with existing DNS resolution flows while providing on-the-fly signing using quantum-resistant signatures. A benchmark has been performed and performance evaluation results reveal significant trade-offs between security and efficiency. The results indicate that while PQC algorithms introduce operational overhead, several candidates offer viable compromises for transitioning DNSSEC to quantum-resistant cryptography.",

      "abstract": "The advent of quantum computing poses a significant challenge as it has the potential to break certain cryptographic algorithms, necessitating a proactive approach to identify and modernize cryptographic code. Identifying these cryptographic elements in existing code is only the first step. It is crucial not only to identify quantum vulnerable algorithms but also to detect vulnerabilities and incorrect crypto usages, to prioritize, report, monitor as well as remediate and modernize code bases. A U.S. government memorandum require agencies to begin their transition to PQC (Post Quantum Cryptograpy) by conducting a prioritized inventory of cryptographic systems including software and hardware systems. In this paper we describe our code scanning tool - Cryptoscope - which leverages cryptographic domain knowledge as well as compiler techniques to statically parse and analyze source code. By analyzing control and data flow the tool is able to build an extendable and querriable inventory of cryptography. Cryptoscope goes beyond identifying disconnected cryptographic APIs and instead provides the user with an inventory of cryptographic assets - containing comprehensive views of the cryptographic operations implemented. We show that for more than 92% of our test cases, these views include the cryptographic operation itself, APIs, as well as the related material such as keys, nonces, random sources etc. Lastly, building on top of this inventory, our tool is able to detect and report all the cryptographic related weaknesses and vulnerabilities (11 out of 15) in CamBench - achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

      "abstract": "The emergence of quantum computing presents a formidable challenge to the security of blockchain systems. Traditional cryptographic algorithms, foundational to digital signatures, message encryption, and hashing functions, become vulnerable to the immense computational power of quantum computers. This paper conducts a thorough risk assessment of transitioning to quantum-resistant blockchains, comprehensively analyzing potential threats targeting vital blockchain components: the network, mining pools, transaction verification mechanisms, smart contracts, and user wallets. By elucidating the intricate challenges and strategic considerations inherent in transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms, the paper evaluates risks and highlights obstacles in securing blockchain components with quantum-resistant cryptography. It offers a hybrid migration strategy to facilitate a smooth transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. The analysis extends to prominent blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash, assessing vulnerable components, potential impacts, and associated STRIDE threats, thereby identifying areas susceptible to quantum attacks. Beyond analysis, the paper provides actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient blockchain ecosystems in the quantum computing era. Recognizing the looming threat of quantum computers, this research advocates for a proactive transition to quantum-resistant blockchain networks.

Shor's algorithm poses a significant threat to RSA and ECC, while Grover's algorithm reduces the security of symmetric encryption schemes, such as AES. The objective of this paper is to underscore the urgency of transitioning to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to mitigate these risks in TCPS by analyzing the vulnerabilities of traditional cryptographic schemes and the applicability of standardized PQC schemes in TCPS. We analyzed vulnerabilities in traditional cryptography against quantum attacks and reviewed the applicability of NIST-standardized PQC schemes, including CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, and SPHINCS+, in TCPS. We conducted a case study to analyze the vulnerabilities of a TCPS application from the Architecture Reference for Cooperative and Intelligent Transportation (ARC-IT) service package, i.e., Electronic Toll Collection, leveraging the Microsoft Threat Modeling tool. This case study highlights the cryptographic vulnerabilities of a TCPS application and presents how PQC can effectively counter these threats. Additionally, we evaluated CRYSTALS-Kyber's performance across wired and wireless TCPS data communication scenarios. While CRYSTALS-Kyber proves effective in securing TCPS applications over high-bandwidth, low-latency Ethernet networks, our analysis highlights challenges in meeting the stringent latency requirements of safety-critical wireless applications within TCPS. Future research should focus on developing lightweight PQC solutions and hybrid schemes that integrate traditional and PQC algorithms, to enhance compatibility, scalability, and real-time performance, ensuring robust protection against emerging quantum threats in TCPS.",

A sufficiently powerful quantum computer could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in these algorithms, rendering data in transit insecure.

Immediate transition to quantum-resilient cryptographic schemes is crucial, primarily to mitigate store-now-decrypt-later attacks and to ensure the security of products with decade-long operational lives. This transition requires a systematic approach to identifying and upgrading vulnerable cryptographic implementations. This work developed a quantum assessment tool for organizations, providing tailored recommendations for transitioning their security protocols into a post-quantum world. The work included a systematic evaluation of the proposed solution using qualitative feedback from network administrators and cybersecurity experts. This feedback was used to refine the accuracy and usability of the assessment process. The results demonstrate its effectiveness and usefulness in helping organizations prepare for quantum computing threats.

This makes the security evaluation of cryptographic systems in quantum attack models significant and urgent. For symmetric ciphers, the security analysis heavily relies on cyptanalytic tools. Thus exploring the use of quantum algorithms to traditional cyptanalytic tools has drawn a lot of attention. In this study, we utilize quantum algorithms to improve impossible differential attack, and design two quantum automatic tools for searching impossible differentials. The proposed quantum algorithms exploit the idea of miss-in-the-middle and the properties of truncated differentials. We rigorously prove their validity and calculate the quantum resources required to implement them.

      "abstract": "With the constantly advancing capabilities of quantum computers, conventional cryptographic systems relying on complex math problems may encounter unforeseen vulnerabilities. Unlike regular computers, which are often deemed cost-ineffective in cryptographic attacks, quantum computers have a significant advantage in calculation speed. This distinction potentially makes currently used algorithms less secure or even completely vulnerable, compelling the exploration of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as the most reasonable solution to quantum threats. This review aims to provide current information on applications, benefits, and challenges associated with the PQC. The review employs a systematic scoping review with the scope restricted to the years 2022 and 2023; only articles that were published in scientific journals were used in this paper. The review examined the articles on the applications of quantum computing in various spheres. However, the scope of this paper was restricted to the domain of the PQC because most of the analyzed articles featured this field. Subsequently, the paper is analyzing various PQC algorithms, including lattice-based, hash-based, code-based, multivariate polynomial, and isogeny-based cryptography. Each algorithm is being judged based on its potential applications, robustness, and challenges. All the analyzed algorithms are promising for the post-quantum era in such applications as digital signatures, communication channels, and IoT. Moreover, some of the algorithms are already implemented in the spheres of banking transactions, communication, and intellectual property. Meanwhile, despite their potential, these algorithms face serious challenges since they lack standardization, require vast amounts of storage and computation power, and might have unknown vulnerabilities that can be discovered only with years of cryptanalysis.",

Quantum telecloning is a protocol that originates from a combination of quantum teleportation and quantum cloning. Here we present $1 \\rightarrow 2$ and $1 \\rightarrow 3$ quantum telecloning circuits, with and without ancilla, that are theoretically optimal (meaning the clones have the highest fidelity allowed by quantum mechanics), universal (meaning the clone fidelity is independent of the state being cloned), and symmetric (meaning the clones all have the same fidelity). We implement these circuits on gate model IBMQ and Quantinuum NISQ hardware and quantify the clone fidelities using parallel single qubit state tomography. Quantum telecloning using mid-circuit measurement with classical feed-forward control (i.e. real time if statements) is demonstrated on the Quantinuum H1-2 device. Two alternative implementations of quantum telecloning, deferred measurement and post selection, are demonstrated on ibmq\\_montreal, where mid-circuit measurements with real time if statements are not available. Our results show that NISQ devices can achieve near-optimal quantum telecloning fidelity; for example the Quantinuum H1-2 device running the telecloning circuits without ancilla achieved a mean clone fidelity of $0.824$ with standard deviation of $0.024$ for two clone circuits and $0.765$ with standard deviation of $0.022$ for three clone circuits. The theoretical fidelity limits are $0.8\\overline{3}$ for two clones and $0.\\overline{7}$ for three clones.

Actual adoption of these emerging technologies requires incorporating cost-effective, fast, QoS-enabled, secure, and scalable design. With the recent advent of quantum computing, the security of current blockchain cryptosystems can be compromised to a greater extent. Quantum algorithms like Shor's large integer factorization algorithm and Grover's unstructured database search algorithm can provide exponential and quadratic speedup, respectively, in contrast to their classical counterpart. This can put threats on both public-key cryptosystems and hash functions, which necessarily demands to migrate from classical cryptography to quantum-secure cryptography.

The relevant quantum-safe blockchain cryptosystem initiatives which have been taken by Bitcoin, Ethereum, Corda, etc. are stated and compared with respect to key sizes, hash length, execution time, computational overhead, and energy efficiency. Post Quantum Cryptographic algorithms like Code-based, Lattice-based, Multivariate-based, and other schemes are not well suited for classical blockchain technology due to several disadvantages in practical implementation.

      "abstract": "In symmetric cryptanalysis, the model of superposition queries has led to surprising results, with many constructions being broken in polynomial time thanks to Simon's period-finding algorithm. But the practical implications of these attacks remain blurry. In contrast, the results obtained so far for a quantum adversary making classical queries only are less impressive. In this paper, we introduce a new quantum algorithm which uses Simon's subroutines in a novel way. We manage to leverage the algebraic structure of cryptosystems in the context of a quantum attacker limited to classical queries and offline quantum computations. We obtain improved quantum-time/classical-data tradeoffs with respect to the current literature, while using only as much hardware requirements (quantum and classical) as a standard exhaustive search with Grover's algorithm. In particular, we are able to break the Even-Mansour construction in quantum time $\\tilde{O}(2^{n/3})$, with $O(2^{n/3})$ classical queries and $O(n^2)$ qubits only. In addition, we improve some previous superposition attacks by reducing the data complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the same time complexity. Our approach can be seen in two complementary ways: \\emph{reusing} superposition queries during the iteration of a search using Grover's algorithm, or alternatively, removing the memory requirement in some quantum attacks based on a collision search, thanks to their algebraic structure. We provide a list of cryptographic applications, including the Even-Mansour construction, the FX construction, some Sponge authenticated modes of encryption, and many more.",

      "abstract": "The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community.   On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of \"cryptographic agility\".",

      "abstract": "The application in cryptography of quantum algorithms for prime factorization fostered the interest in quantum computing. However, quantum computers, and particularly quantum annealers, can also be helpful to construct secure cryptographic keys. Indeed, finding robust Boolean functions for cryptography is an important problem in sequence ciphers, block ciphers, and hash functions, among others. Due to the super-exponential size $\\mathcal{O}(2^{2^n})$ of the associated space, finding $n$-variable Boolean functions with global cryptographic constraints is computationally hard. This problem has already been addressed employing generic low-connected incoherent D-Wave quantum annealers. However, the limited connectivity of the Chimera graph, together with the exponential growth in the complexity of the Boolean function design problem, limit the problem scalability. Here, we propose a special-purpose coherent quantum annealing architecture with three couplers per qubit, designed to optimally encode the bent function design problem. A coherent quantum annealer with this tree-type architecture has the potential to solve the $8$-variable bent function design problem, which is classically unsolved, with only $127$ physical qubits and $126$ couplers. This paves the way to reach useful quantum supremacy within the framework of quantum annealing for cryptographic purposes.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computation provides exponential speedup for solving certain mathematical problems against classical computers. Motivated by current rapid experimental progress on quantum computing devices, various models of quantum computation have been investigated to show quantum computational supremacy. At a commercial side, quantum annealing machine realizes the quantum Ising model with a transverse field and heuristically solves combinatorial optimization problems. The computational power of this machine is closely related to adiabatic quantum computation (AQC) with a restricted type of Hamiltonians, namely stoquastic Hamiltonians, and has been thought to be relatively less powerful compared to universal quantum computers. Little is known about computational quantum speedup nor advantage in AQC with stoquastic Hamiltonians. Here we characterize computational capability of AQC with stoquastic Hamiltonians, which we call stoqAQC. We construct a concrete stoqAQC model, whose lowest energy gap is lower bounded polynomially, and hence the final state can be obtained in polynomial time. Then we show that it can simulate universal quantum computation if adaptive single-qubit measurements in non-standard bases are allowed on the final state. Even if the measurements are restricted to non-adaptive measurements to respect the robustness of AQC, the proposed model exhibits quantum computational supremacy; classical simulation is impossible under complexity theoretical conjectures. Moreover, it is found that such a stoqAQC model can simulate Shor's algorithm and solve the factoring problem in polynomial time. We also propose how to overcome the measurement imperfections via quantum error correction within the stoqAQC model and also an experimentally feasible verification scheme to test whether or not stoqAQC is done faithfully.",

      "abstract": "Traditional cryptography is suffering a huge threat from the development of quantum computing. While many currently used public-key cryptosystems would be broken by Shor's algorithm, the effect of quantum computing on symmetric ones is still unclear. The security of symmetric ciphers relies heavily on the development of cryptanalytic tools. Thus, in order to accurately evaluate the security of symmetric primitives in the post-quantum world, it is significant to improve classical cryptanalytic methods using quantum algorithms. In this paper, we focus on two variants of differential cryptanalysis: truncated differential cryptanalysis and impossible differential cryptanalysis. Based on the fact that Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm can be used to find the linear structures of Boolean functions, we propose two quantum algorithms that can be used to find high-probability truncated differentials and impossible differentials of block ciphers, respectively. We rigorously prove the validity of the algorithms and analyze their complexity. Our algorithms treat all rounds of the reduced cipher as a whole and only concerns the input and output differences at its both ends, instead of specific differential characteristics. Therefore, to a certain extent, they alleviate the weakness of conventional differential cryptanalysis, namely the difficulties in finding differential characteristics as the number of rounds increases.",

      "abstract": "Due to Shor's algorithm, quantum computers are a severe threat for public key cryptography. This motivated the cryptographic community to search for quantum-safe solutions. On the other hand, the impact of quantum computing on secret key cryptography is much less understood. In this paper, we consider attacks where an adversary can query an oracle implementing a cryptographic primitive in a quantum superposition of different states. This model gives a lot of power to the adversary, but recent results show that it is nonetheless possible to build secure cryptosystems in it.   We study applications of a quantum procedure called Simon's algorithm (the simplest quantum period finding algorithm) in order to attack symmetric cryptosystems in this model. Following previous works in this direction, we show that several classical attacks based on finding collisions can be dramatically sped up using Simon's algorithm: finding a collision requires $\\Omega(2^{n/2})$ queries in the classical setting, but when collisions happen with some hidden periodicity, they can be found with only $O(n)$ queries in the quantum model.   We obtain attacks with very strong implications. First, we show that the most widely used modes of operation for authentication and authenticated encryption e.g. CBC-MAC, PMAC, GMAC, GCM, and OCB) are completely broken in this security model. Our attacks are also applicable to many CAESAR candidates: CLOC, AEZ, COPA, OTR, POET, OMD, and Minalpher. This is quite surprising compared to the situation with encryption modes: Anand et al. show that standard modes are secure with a quantum-secure PRF.   Second, we show that Simon's algorithm can also be applied to slide attacks, leading to an exponential speed-up of a classical symmetric cryptanalysis technique in the quantum model.",
