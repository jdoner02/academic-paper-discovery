      "abstract": "Some of our current public key methods use a trap door to implement digital signature methods. This includes the RSA method, which uses Fermat's little theorem to support the creation and verification of a digital signature. The problem with a back-door is that the actual trap-door method could, in the end, be discovered. With the rise of PQC (Post Quantum Cryptography), we will see a range of methods that will not use trap doors and provide stronger proof of security. In this case, we use hash-based signatures (as used with SPHINCS+) and Fiat Shamir signatures using Zero Knowledge Proofs (as used with Dilithium).",

      "abstract": "The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community.   On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of \"cryptographic agility\".",

      "abstract": "Due to the current standard of Security Credential Management System (SCMS) for Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications using asymmetric cryptography, specifically Elliptic-Curve Cryptography (ECC), which may be vulnerable to quantum computing attacks. Therefore, the V2X SCMS is threatened by quantum computing attacks. However, although the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has already selected Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms as the standard, the current PQC algorithms may have issues such as longer public key lengths, longer signature lengths, or lower signature generation and verification efficiency, which may not fully meet the requirements of V2X communication applications. In view of the challenges in V2X communication, such as packet length, signature generation and verification efficiency, security level, and vehicle privacy, this study proposes a hybrid certificate scheme of PQC and ECC. By leveraging the strengths of both PQC and ECC, this scheme aims to overcome the challenges in V2X communication. PQC is used to establish a security level resistant to quantum computing attacks, while ECC is utilized to establish anonymous certificates and reduce packet length to meet the requirements of V2X communication. In the practical experiments, the study implemented the SCMS end entity based on the Chunghwa Telecom SCMS and the Clientron On-Board Unit (OBU) to conduct field tests in Danhai New Town in New Taipei City. The performance of various existing hybrid certificate schemes combining PQC (e.g., Dilithium, Falcon, and SPHINCS+) and ECC is compared, and a practical solution is provided for V2X industries.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the advancement of quantum computing technology has posed potential security threats to RSA cryptography and elliptic curve cryptography. In response, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) published several Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in August 2024, including the Module-Lattice-Based Key-Encapsulation Mechanism (ML-KEM), Module-Lattice-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (ML-DSA), and Stateless Hash-Based Digital Signature Algorithm (SLH-DSA). Although these PQC algorithms are designed to resist quantum computing attacks, they may not provide adequate security in certain specialized application scenarios. To address this issue, this study proposes quantum random number generator (QRNG)-based PQC algorithms. These algorithms leverage quantum computing to generate random numbers, which serve as the foundation for key pair generation, key encapsulation, and digital signature generation. A generalized architecture of QRNG is proposed, along with the design of six QRNGs. Each generator is evaluated according to the statistical validation procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-90B, including tests for verification of entropy sources and independent and identically distributed (IID) outputs. Experimental results assess the computation time of the six QRNGs, as well as the performance of QRNG-based ML-KEM, QRNG-based ML-DSA, and QRNG-based SLH-DSA. These findings provide valuable reference data for future deployment of PQC systems.",

      "abstract": "Security of currently deployed public key cryptography algorithms is foreseen to be vulnerable against quantum computer attacks. Hence, a community effort exists to develop post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, i.e., algorithms that are resistant to quantum attacks. In this work, we have investigated how lattice-based candidate algorithms from the NIST PQC standardization competition fare when conceived as hardware accelerators. To achieve this, we have assessed the reference implementations of selected algorithms with the goal of identifying what are their basic building blocks. We assume the hardware accelerators will be implemented in application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) and the targeted technology in our experiments is a commercial 65nm node. In order to estimate the characteristics of each algorithm, we have assessed their memory requirements, use of multipliers, and how each algorithm employs hashing functions. Furthermore, for these building blocks, we have collected area and power figures for 12 candidate algorithms. For memories, we make use of a commercial memory compiler. For logic, we make use of a standard cell library. In order to compare the candidate algorithms fairly, we select a reference frequency of operation of 500MHz. Our results reveal that our area and power numbers are comparable to the state of the art, despite targeting a higher frequency of operation and a higher security level in our experiments. The comprehensive investigation of lattice-based NIST PQC algorithms performed in this paper can be used for guiding ASIC designers when selecting an appropriate algorithm while respecting requirements and design constraints.",

      "abstract": "This paper conducts a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of the performance of two innovative cryptographic schemes: Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key (HPPK)-Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and Digital Signature (DS), recently proposed by Kuang et al. These schemes represent a departure from traditional cryptographic paradigms, with HPPK leveraging the security of homomorphic symmetric encryption across two hidden rings without reliance on NP-hard problems. HPPK can be viewed as a specialized variant of Multivariate Public Key Cryptography (MPKC), intricately associated with two vector spaces: the polynomial vector space for the secret exchange and the multivariate vector space for randomized encapsulation.   The unique integration of asymmetric, symmetric, and homomorphic cryptography within HPPK necessitates a careful examination of its performance metrics. This study focuses on the thorough benchmarking of HPPK KEM and DS across key cryptographic operations, encompassing key generation, encapsulation, decapsulation, signing, and verification. The results highlight the exceptional efficiency of HPPK, characterized by compact key sizes, cipher sizes, and signature sizes. The use of symmetric encryption in HPPK enhances its overall performance. Key findings underscore the outstanding performance of HPPK KEM and DS across various security levels, emphasizing their superiority in crucial cryptographic operations. This research positions HPPK as a promising and competitive solution for post-quantum cryptographic applications in a wide range of applications, including blockchain, digital currency, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices.",

      "abstract": "The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.   This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.   This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024.

They extended MPPK into Homomorphic Polynomial Public Key (HPPK), employing homomorphic encryption for large hidden ring operations. Originally designed for key encapsulation (KEM), HPPK's security relies on homomorphic encryption of public polynomials. This paper expands HPPK KEM to a digital signature scheme, facing challenges due to the distinct nature of verification compared to decryption. To adapt HPPK KEM to digital signatures, the authors introduce an extension of the Barrett reduction algorithm, transforming modular multiplications into divisions in the verification equation over a prime field. The extended algorithm non-linearly embeds the signature into public polynomial coefficients, addressing vulnerabilities in earlier MPPK DS schemes. Security analysis demonstrates exponential complexity for private key recovery and forged signature attacks, considering ring bit length twice that of the prime field size.",

An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks.

      "abstract": "Today's information society relies on cryptography to achieve security goals such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation for digital communications. Here, public-key cryptosystems play a pivotal role to share encryption keys and create digital signatures. However, quantum computers threaten the security of traditional public-key cryptosystems as they can tame computational problems underlying the schemes, i.e., discrete logarithm and integer factorization. The prospective arrival of capable-enough quantum computers already threatens today's secret communication in terms of their long-term secrecy when stored to be later decrypted. Therefore, researchers strive to develop and deploy alternative schemes.   In this work, evaluate a key exchange protocol based on combining public-key schemes with physical-layer security, anticipating the prospect of quantum attacks. If powerful quantum attackers cannot immediately obtain private keys, legitimate parties have a window of short-term secrecy to perform a physical-layer jamming key exchange (JKE) to establish a long-term shared secret. Thereby, the protocol constraints the computation time available to the attacker to break the employed public-key cryptography. In this paper, we outline the protocol, discuss its security, and point out challenges to be resolved.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computers could break currently used asymmetric cryptographic schemes in a few years using Shor's algorithm. They are used in numerous protocols and applications to secure authenticity as well as key agreement, and quantum-safe alternatives are urgently needed. NIST therefore initiated a standardization process. This requires intensive evaluation, also with regard to performance and integrability. Here, the integration into TLS 1.3 plays an important role, since it is used for 90% of all Internet connections. In the present work, algorithms for quantum-safe key exchange during TLS 1.3 handshake were reviewed. The focus is on the influence of dedicated network parameters such as transmission rate or packet loss in order to gain insights regarding the suitability of the algorithms under corresponding network conditions. For the implementation, a framework by Paquin et al. was extended to emulate network scenarios and capture the handshake duration for selected algorithms. It is shown that the evaluated candidates Kyber, Saber and NTRU as well as the alternative NTRU Prime have a very good overall performance and partly undercut the handshake duration of the classical ECDH. The choice of a higher security level or hybrid variants does not make a significant difference here. This is not the case with alternatives such as FrodoKEM, SIKE, HQC or BIKE, which have individual disadvantages and whose respective performance varies greatly depending on the security level and hybrid implementation. This is especially true for the data-intensive algorithm FrodoKEM. In general, the prevailing network characteristics should be taken into account when choosing scheme and variant. Further it becomes clear that the performance of the handshake is influenced by external factors such as TCP mechanisms or MTU, which could compensate for possible disadvantages due to PQC if configured appropriately.",

Trustworthiness of the streamed data is crucial which requires quantum safety and breach resiliency. Digital signatures are essential for scalable authentication and non-repudiation. Yet, NIST PQC signature standards are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoT without considering forward security. Moreover, Post-Quantum (PQ) signatures lack aggregation, which is highly desirable to reduce the transmission and storage burdens in DTs. Hence, there is an urgent need for lightweight digital signatures that offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting an effective transition into the PQ era for DTs.   We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called Hardware-ASsisted Efficient Signature (HASES) that meets the above requirements. The core of HASES is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment construct oracle (CCO) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments without signer interaction. We created three HASES schemes: PQ-HASES is a forward-secure PQ signature, LA-HASES is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve signature, and HY-HASES is a novel hybrid scheme that combines PQ-HASES and LA-HASES with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation. HASES does not require a secure-hardware on the signer. We proved that HASES schemes are secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and an 8-bit AVR ATmega2560. Our experiments confirm that PQ-HASES and LA-HASES are two magnitudes of times more signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts, respectively. HY-HASES outperforms NIST PQC and conventional signature combinations, offering a standardcompliant transitional solution for emerging DTs. We open-source HASES schemes for public testing and adaptation.",

To address this impending issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently undertaking the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project intending to evaluate and subsequently standardize the suitable PQC scheme(s). One such attractive approach, called Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE), has made to the final round of the competition. Despite having some attractive features, the IND-CCA security of the BIKE depends on the average decoder failure rate (DFR), a higher value of which can facilitate a particular type of side-channel attack. Although the BIKE adopts a Black-Grey-Flip (BGF) decoder that offers a negligible DFR, the effect of weak-keys on the average DFR has not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we first perform an implementation of the BIKE scheme, and then through extensive experiments show that the weak-keys can be a potential threat to IND-CCA security of the BIKE scheme and thus need attention from the research community prior to standardization. We also propose a key-check algorithm that can potentially supplement the BIKE mechanism and prevent users from generating and adopting weak keys to address this issue.",

At the same time, practical key exchange protocols based on Diffie-Hellman (DH) or ECDSA primitives are not designed or implemented in a threshold setting. In this paper, we implement popular key exchange protocols in a threshold manner and show that this approach can be used in practice. First, we introduce two basic threshold DH key agreement schemes that provide enhanced security features in comparison with the classic DH primitive: dealerless distributed key generation, threshold shared key computation, and private key shares refreshing. We implemented the proposed DH schemes within WireGuard protocol to demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency, and usability in practice. The open question is the security of the proposed schemes and their instantiation from the elliptic curves used in key agreement protocols: NIST curves, Russian GOST curves, and Curve25519. Second, we propose an idea of implementing TLS in a threshold setting that can be used instead of Keyless SSL/TLS technology, and provide the measurements of TLS key exchanges based on threshold ECDSA. Even if we don't provide any formal definitions, security analysis, and mathematical proofs, we believe that the ideas and mechanisms suggested in this paper can be interesting and useful. The main intention of the paper is to start discussions and raise awareness of the challenges and problems arising when moving to threshold key exchange protocols.",

Recently, one-time universal hashing QDS framework, exploiting the quantum asymmetric encryption and universal hash functions, has been proposed to significantly improve the signature rate and ensure unconditional security by directly signing the hash value of long messages. However, similar to quantum key distribution, this framework utilizes keys with perfect secrecy by performing privacy amplification that introduces cumbersome matrix operations, thereby consuming large computational resources, causing delays and increasing failure probability. Here, we prove that, different from private communication, imperfect quantum keys with limited information leakage can be used for digital signatures and authentication without compromising the security while having eight orders of magnitude improvement on signature rate for signing a megabit message compared with conventional single-bit schemes. This study significantly reduces the delay for data postprocessing and is compatible with any quantum key generation protocols. In our simulation, taking two-photon twin-field key generation protocol as an example, QDS can be practically implemented over a fiber distance of 650 km between the signer and receiver. For the first time, this study offers a cryptographic application of quantum keys with imperfect secrecy and paves a way for the practical and agile implementation of digital signatures in a future quantum network.",

These constraints raise concerns about the feasibility of implementing PQC in automotive environments, where legacy hardware and bit rate limitations must also be considered.   In this paper, we introduce PQ-CAN, a modular framework for simulating the performance and overhead of PQC algorithms in embedded systems. We consider the automotive domain as our case study, testing a variety of PQC schemes under different scenarios. Our simulation enables the adjustment of embedded system computational capabilities and CAN bus bit rate constraints. We also provide insights into the trade-offs involved by analyzing each algorithm's security level and overhead for key encapsulation and digital signature. By evaluating the performance of these algorithms, we provide insights into their feasibility and identify the strengths and limitations of PQC in securing automotive communications in the post-quantum era.",

In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.   To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time.   To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).   We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way. Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.",

The protocol functions as a true public-key cryptography system, where the public key is a set of local density matrices generated from the private key, a global quantum state. This construction uniquely eliminates the need for trusted third parties, pre-shared secrets, or authenticated classical channels for public key distribution, making a significant departure from symmetric protocols like quantum key distribution. We provide a rigorous security analysis, proving the scheme's unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks by quantum adversaries. The proof proceeds by a formal reduction, demonstrating that a successful forgery would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the QMA-complete Consistency of Quantum Marginal Problem~(QMP). We further analyze the efficiency of verification using partial quantum state tomography, establishing the protocol's theoretical robustness and outlining a path towards practical implementation",

      "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows Alice and Bob to agree on a shared secret key, while communicating over a public (untrusted) quantum channel. Compared to classical key exchange, it has two main advantages: (i) The key is unconditionally hidden to the eyes of any attacker, and (ii) its security assumes only the existence of authenticated classical channels which, in practice, can be realized using Minicrypt assumptions, such as the existence of digital signatures. On the flip side, QKD protocols typically require multiple rounds of interactions, whereas classical key exchange can be realized with the minimal amount of two messages using public-key encryption. A long-standing open question is whether QKD requires more rounds of interaction than classical key exchange. In this work, we propose a two-message QKD protocol that satisfies everlasting security, assuming only the existence of quantum-secure one-way functions. That is, the shared key is unconditionally hidden, provided computational assumptions hold during the protocol execution. Our result follows from a new construction of quantum public-key encryption (QPKE) whose security, much like its classical counterpart, only relies on authenticated classical channels.",

A mostly overlooked but valuable line of solutions is provided by non-commutative algebraic structures, specifically canonical protocols that rely on one-way trapdoor functions (OWTF). Here we develop an algebraic framework who could be applied to different asymmetric protocols like D-H KE (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), Public Key Encryption, Digital Signature, ZKP (zero-knowledge proof) authentication, Oblivious Transfer, Multi-Party Computing, and so on. The trapdoor one-way functions selected are (a) Triple decomposition Problem (TDP) developed by Kurt, where a known element is factored into a product of three unknown factors and (b) a new version of conjugacy search that we refer from now on as Blind Conjugacy Search Problem (BCSP). Our platform structure is the general linear group GL(d,F_p) d-square non-singular matrices of prime field values. We give support to the fact that this framework is cryptographically secure against classical attacks like linear algebra attacks, length-based attacks, side-channel attacks against square (or duplicate) and multiply (or sum) algorithm, high sensitivity to pseudo random deterministic generators, etc. At same time it is immune against quantum attacks (using Grover and Shor), if the size parameters are carefully selected.

The McEliece cryptosystem and its security equivalent, the Niederreiter cryptosystem, which are based on Goppa codes, are one of the solutions, but they are not practical due to their long key length. Several prior attempts to decrease the length of the public key in code-based cryptosystems involved substituting the Goppa code family with other code families. However, these efforts ultimately proved to be insecure. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) called for proposals from around the world to standardize post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes to solve this issue. After receiving of various proposals in this field, the Classic McEliece cryptosystem, as well as the Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) and Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE), chosen as code-based encryption category cryptosystems that successfully progressed to the final stage. This article proposes a method for developing a code-based public key cryptography scheme that is both simple and implementable. The proposed scheme has a much shorter public key length compared to the NIST finalist cryptosystems. The key length for the primary parameters of the McEliece cryptosystem (n=1024, k=524, t=50) ranges from 18 to 500 bits. The security of this system is at least as strong as the security of the Niederreiter cryptosystem. The proposed structure is based on the Niederreiter cryptosystem which exhibits a set of highly advantageous properties that make it a suitable candidate for implementation in all extant systems.",

      "abstract": "The notion of aggregate signature has been motivated by applications and it enables any user to compress different signatures signed by different signers on different messages into a short signature. Sequential aggregate signature, in turn, is a special kind of aggregate signature that only allows a signer to add his signature into an aggregate signature in sequential order. This latter scheme has applications in diversified settings such as in reducing bandwidth of certificate chains and in secure routing protocols. Lu, Ostrovsky, Sahai, Shacham, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2006) presented the first sequential aggregate signature scheme in the standard model. The size of their public key, however, is quite large (i.e., the number of group elements is proportional to the security parameter), and therefore, they suggested as an open problem the construction of such a scheme with short keys.   In this paper, we propose the first sequential aggregate signature schemes with short public keys (i.e., a constant number of group elements) in prime order (asymmetric) bilinear groups that are secure under static assumptions in the standard model. Furthermore, our schemes employ a constant number of pairing operations per message signing and message verification operation. Technically, we start with a public-key signature scheme based on the recent dual system encryption technique of Lewko and Waters (TCC 2010). This technique cannot directly provide an aggregate signature scheme since, as we observed, additional elements should be published in a public key to support aggregation. Thus, our constructions are careful augmentation techniques for the dual system technique to allow it to support sequential aggregate signature schemes. We also propose a multi-signature scheme with short public parameters in the standard model.",

This analysis and its assessment have been performed using OSNMA documentation, reviewing the available Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms competing in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process, and studying the possibility of its implementation in the Galileo service. The main barrier to adopting the PQC approach is the size of both the signature and the key. The analysis shows that OSNMA is not yet prepared to face the quantum threat, and a significant change would be required.

      "abstract": "We demonstrate a post-quantum key-exchange with the nanosatellite SpooQy-1 in low Earth orbit using Kyber-512, a lattice-based key-encapsulation mechanism and a round three finalist in the NIST PQC standardization process. Our firmware solution runs on an on-board computer that is based on the Atmel AVR32 RISC microcontroller, a widely used platform for nanosatellites. We uploaded the new firmware with a 436.2 MHz UHF link using the CubeSat Space Protocol (CSP) and performed the steps of the key exchange in several passes over Switzerland. The shared secret key generated in this experiment could potentially be used to encrypt RF links with AES-256. This implementation demonstrates the feasibility of a quantum-safe authenticated key-exchange and encryption system on SWaP constrained nanosatellites.",
