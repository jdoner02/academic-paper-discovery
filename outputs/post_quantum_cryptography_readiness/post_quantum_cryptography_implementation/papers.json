      "abstract": "We propose a quantum authentication and digital signature protocol whose security is founded on the Quantum Merlin Arthur~(QMA)-completeness of the consistency of local density matrices. The protocol functions as a true public-key cryptography system, where the public key is a set of local density matrices generated from the private key, a global quantum state. This construction uniquely eliminates the need for trusted third parties, pre-shared secrets, or authenticated classical channels for public key distribution, making a significant departure from symmetric protocols like quantum key distribution. We provide a rigorous security analysis, proving the scheme's unforgeability against adaptive chosen-message attacks by quantum adversaries. The proof proceeds by a formal reduction, demonstrating that a successful forgery would imply an efficient quantum algorithm for the QMA-complete Consistency of Quantum Marginal Problem~(QMP). We further analyze the efficiency of verification using partial quantum state tomography, establishing the protocol's theoretical robustness and outlining a path towards practical implementation",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing threatens the security foundations of consumer electronics (CE). Preparing the diverse CE ecosystem, particularly resource-constrained devices, for the post-quantum era requires quantitative understanding of quantum-resistant cryptography (PQC) performance. This paper presents a comprehensive cross-platform performance analysis of leading PQC Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs) and digital signatures (NIST standards/candidates) compared against classical RSA/ECC. We evaluated execution time, communication costs (key/signature sizes), and memory footprint indicators on high-performance (macOS/M4, Ubuntu/x86) and constrained platforms (Raspberry Pi 4/ARM). Our quantitative results reveal lattice-based schemes, notably NIST standards ML-KEM (Kyber) and ML-DSA (Dilithium), provide a strong balance of computational efficiency and moderate communication/storage overhead, making them highly suitable for many CE applications. In contrast, code-based Classic McEliece imposes significant key size challenges, while hash-based SPHINCS+ offers high security assurance but demands large signature sizes impacting bandwidth and storage. Based on empirical data across platforms and security levels, we provide specific deployment recommendations tailored to different CE scenarios (e.g., wearables, smart home hubs, mobile devices), offering guidance for manufacturers navigating the PQC transition.",

This paper first provides a comprehensive analysis of the hardware complexity of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) in embedded systems, categorizing PQC algorithms into families based on their underlying mathematical problems: lattice-based, code-based, hash-based and multivariate / isogeny-based schemes. Each family presents distinct computational, memory, and energy profiles, making them suitable for different use cases. To address these challenges, this paper discusses optimization strategies such as pipelining, parallelization, and high-level synthesis (HLS), which can improve the performance and energy efficiency of PQC implementations. Finally, a detailed complexity analysis of CRYSTALS-Kyber and McEliece, comparing their key generation, encryption, and decryption processes in terms of computational complexity, has been conducted.",

      "abstract": "The rapid development of quantum computers threatens traditional cryptographic schemes, prompting the need for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC). Although the NIST standardization process has accelerated the development of such algorithms, their application in resource-constrained environments such as embedded systems remains a challenge. Automotive systems relying on the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus for communication are particularly vulnerable due to their limited computational capabilities, high traffic, and need for real-time response. These constraints raise concerns about the feasibility of implementing PQC in automotive environments, where legacy hardware and bit rate limitations must also be considered.   In this paper, we introduce PQ-CAN, a modular framework for simulating the performance and overhead of PQC algorithms in embedded systems. We consider the automotive domain as our case study, testing a variety of PQC schemes under different scenarios. Our simulation enables the adjustment of embedded system computational capabilities and CAN bus bit rate constraints. We also provide insights into the trade-offs involved by analyzing each algorithm's security level and overhead for key encapsulation and digital signature. By evaluating the performance of these algorithms, we provide insights into their feasibility and identify the strengths and limitations of PQC in securing automotive communications in the post-quantum era.",

The proposed protocol optimizes security by using post-quantum public key encryption to protect the shared secrets from intermediate nodes in the QKDN, thereby reducing the risk of attacks by malicious intermediaries. Finally, relevant use cases are presented, such as critical infrastructure networks, interconnection of data centers and digital money, demonstrating the applicability of the proposal in critical high-security environments.",

Two standardized protocols, 5G AKA and EAP AKA', handle authentication for 3GPP and non 3GPP devices. However, 5G AKA has vulnerabilities, including linkability attacks. Additionally, quantum computing poses threats, requiring quantum resistant cryptography. While post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is being standardized, its real world robustness remains unproven. Conventional cryptographic schemes offer reliability due to decades of practical use. To bridge this gap, IETF is standardizing hybrid PQC (HPQC), combining classical and quantum resistant methods. Ensuring forward secrecy and quantum resilience in 5G-AKA is critical. To address these issues, we propose 5G AKA HPQC, a protocol maintaining compatibility with existing standards while enhancing security by integrating keys derived from Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme (ECIES) and PQC Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM). We validate its security using SVO Logic and ProVerif, confirming its robustness. Performance evaluations assess computational and communication overheads, demonstrating a balance between security and efficiency.

      "abstract": "Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) between any two entities is one of the most important security protocols available for securing our digital networks and infrastructures. In PQCrypto 2023, Bruckner, Ramacher and Striecks proposed a novel hybrid AKE (HAKE) protocol, dubbed Muckle+, that is particularly useful in large quantum-safe networks consisting of a large number of nodes. Their protocol is hybrid in the sense that it allows key material from conventional and post-quantum primitives, as well as from quantum key distribution, to be incorporated into a single end-to-end shared key.   To achieve the desired authentication properties, Muckle+ utilizes post-quantum digital signatures. However, available instantiations of such signatures schemes are not yet efficient enough compared to their post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanism (KEM) counterparts, particularly in large networks with potentially several connections in a short period of time.   To mitigate this gap, we propose Muckle# that pushes the efficiency boundaries of currently known HAKE constructions. Muckle# uses post-quantum key-encapsulating mechanisms for implicit authentication inspired by recent works done in the area of Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols, particularly, in KEMTLS (CCS'20).   We port those ideas to the HAKE framework and develop novel proof techniques on the way. Due to our novel KEM-based approach, the resulting protocol has a slightly different message flow compared to prior work that we carefully align with the HAKE framework and which makes our changes to the Muckle+ non-trivial.",

In this paper, we analyse the state of the Galileo Open Service Navigation Message Authentication (OSNMA) to overcome these new threats. This analysis and its assessment have been performed using OSNMA documentation, reviewing the available Post Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms competing in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standardization process, and studying the possibility of its implementation in the Galileo service. The main barrier to adopting the PQC approach is the size of both the signature and the key. The analysis shows that OSNMA is not yet prepared to face the quantum threat, and a significant change would be required.

      "abstract": "Due to the weakness of public key cryptosystems encounter of quantum computers, the need to provide a solution was emerged. The McEliece cryptosystem and its security equivalent, the Niederreiter cryptosystem, which are based on Goppa codes, are one of the solutions, but they are not practical due to their long key length. Several prior attempts to decrease the length of the public key in code-based cryptosystems involved substituting the Goppa code family with other code families. However, these efforts ultimately proved to be insecure. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) called for proposals from around the world to standardize post-quantum cryptography (PQC) schemes to solve this issue. After receiving of various proposals in this field, the Classic McEliece cryptosystem, as well as the Hamming Quasi-Cyclic (HQC) and Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE), chosen as code-based encryption category cryptosystems that successfully progressed to the final stage. This article proposes a method for developing a code-based public key cryptography scheme that is both simple and implementable. The proposed scheme has a much shorter public key length compared to the NIST finalist cryptosystems. The key length for the primary parameters of the McEliece cryptosystem (n=1024, k=524, t=50) ranges from 18 to 500 bits. The security of this system is at least as strong as the security of the Niederreiter cryptosystem. The proposed structure is based on the Niederreiter cryptosystem which exhibits a set of highly advantageous properties that make it a suitable candidate for implementation in all extant systems.",

      "abstract": "Digital Twins (DT) virtually model cyber-physical objects using Internet of Things (IoT) components (e.g., sensors) to gather and process senstive information stored in the cloud. Trustworthiness of the streamed data is crucial which requires quantum safety and breach resiliency. Digital signatures are essential for scalable authentication and non-repudiation. Yet, NIST PQC signature standards are exorbitantly costly for low-end IoT without considering forward security. Moreover, Post-Quantum (PQ) signatures lack aggregation, which is highly desirable to reduce the transmission and storage burdens in DTs. Hence, there is an urgent need for lightweight digital signatures that offer compromise resiliency and compactness while permitting an effective transition into the PQ era for DTs.   We create a series of highly lightweight digital signatures called Hardware-ASsisted Efficient Signature (HASES) that meets the above requirements. The core of HASES is a hardware-assisted cryptographic commitment construct oracle (CCO) that permits verifiers to obtain expensive commitments without signer interaction. We created three HASES schemes: PQ-HASES is a forward-secure PQ signature, LA-HASES is an efficient aggregate Elliptic-Curve signature, and HY-HASES is a novel hybrid scheme that combines PQ-HASES and LA-HASES with novel strong nesting and sequential aggregation. HASES does not require a secure-hardware on the signer. We proved that HASES schemes are secure and implemented them on commodity hardware and an 8-bit AVR ATmega2560. Our experiments confirm that PQ-HASES and LA-HASES are two magnitudes of times more signer efficient than their PQ and conventional-secure counterparts, respectively. HY-HASES outperforms NIST PQC and conventional signature combinations, offering a standardcompliant transitional solution for emerging DTs. We open-source HASES schemes for public testing and adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Quantum key distribution (QKD) allows Alice and Bob to agree on a shared secret key, while communicating over a public (untrusted) quantum channel. Compared to classical key exchange, it has two main advantages: (i) The key is unconditionally hidden to the eyes of any attacker, and (ii) its security assumes only the existence of authenticated classical channels which, in practice, can be realized using Minicrypt assumptions, such as the existence of digital signatures. On the flip side, QKD protocols typically require multiple rounds of interactions, whereas classical key exchange can be realized with the minimal amount of two messages using public-key encryption. A long-standing open question is whether QKD requires more rounds of interaction than classical key exchange. In this work, we propose a two-message QKD protocol that satisfies everlasting security, assuming only the existence of quantum-secure one-way functions. That is, the shared key is unconditionally hidden, provided computational assumptions hold during the protocol execution. Our result follows from a new construction of quantum public-key encryption (QPKE) whose security, much like its classical counterpart, only relies on authenticated classical channels.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computers could break currently used asymmetric cryptographic schemes in a few years using Shor's algorithm. They are used in numerous protocols and applications to secure authenticity as well as key agreement, and quantum-safe alternatives are urgently needed. NIST therefore initiated a standardization process. This requires intensive evaluation, also with regard to performance and integrability. Here, the integration into TLS 1.3 plays an important role, since it is used for 90% of all Internet connections. In the present work, algorithms for quantum-safe key exchange during TLS 1.3 handshake were reviewed. The focus is on the influence of dedicated network parameters such as transmission rate or packet loss in order to gain insights regarding the suitability of the algorithms under corresponding network conditions. For the implementation, a framework by Paquin et al. was extended to emulate network scenarios and capture the handshake duration for selected algorithms. It is shown that the evaluated candidates Kyber, Saber and NTRU as well as the alternative NTRU Prime have a very good overall performance and partly undercut the handshake duration of the classical ECDH. The choice of a higher security level or hybrid variants does not make a significant difference here. This is not the case with alternatives such as FrodoKEM, SIKE, HQC or BIKE, which have individual disadvantages and whose respective performance varies greatly depending on the security level and hybrid implementation. This is especially true for the data-intensive algorithm FrodoKEM. In general, the prevailing network characteristics should be taken into account when choosing scheme and variant. Further it becomes clear that the performance of the handshake is influenced by external factors such as TCP mechanisms or MTU, which could compensate for possible disadvantages due to PQC if configured appropriately.",

Recently, one-time universal hashing QDS framework, exploiting the quantum asymmetric encryption and universal hash functions, has been proposed to significantly improve the signature rate and ensure unconditional security by directly signing the hash value of long messages. However, similar to quantum key distribution, this framework utilizes keys with perfect secrecy by performing privacy amplification that introduces cumbersome matrix operations, thereby consuming large computational resources, causing delays and increasing failure probability. Here, we prove that, different from private communication, imperfect quantum keys with limited information leakage can be used for digital signatures and authentication without compromising the security while having eight orders of magnitude improvement on signature rate for signing a megabit message compared with conventional single-bit schemes. This study significantly reduces the delay for data postprocessing and is compatible with any quantum key generation protocols. In our simulation, taking two-photon twin-field key generation protocol as an example, QDS can be practically implemented over a fiber distance of 650 km between the signer and receiver. For the first time, this study offers a cryptographic application of quantum keys with imperfect secrecy and paves a way for the practical and agile implementation of digital signatures in a future quantum network.",

On a Xilinx Ultrascale+ FPGA, the proposed cryptoprocessor consumes 18,406 LUTs, 9,323 FFs, 4 DSPs, and 24 BRAMs. It achieves 200 MHz clock frequency and finishes CCA-secure key-generation/encapsulation/decapsulation operations for LightSaber in 29.6/40.4/58.3$\\mu$s; for Saber in 54.9/69.7/94.9$\\mu$s; and for FireSaber in 87.6/108.0/139.4$\\mu$s, respectively. It finishes key-generation/sign/verify operations for Dilithium-2 in 70.9/151.6/75.2$\\mu$s; for Dilithium-3 in 114.7/237/127.6$\\mu$s; and for Dilithium-5 in 194.2/342.1/228.9$\\mu$s, respectively, for the best-case scenario. On UMC 65nm library for ASIC the latency is improved by a factor of two due to a 2x increase in clock frequency.",

To address this impending issue, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is currently undertaking the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standardization project intending to evaluate and subsequently standardize the suitable PQC scheme(s). One such attractive approach, called Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE), has made to the final round of the competition. Despite having some attractive features, the IND-CCA security of the BIKE depends on the average decoder failure rate (DFR), a higher value of which can facilitate a particular type of side-channel attack. Although the BIKE adopts a Black-Grey-Flip (BGF) decoder that offers a negligible DFR, the effect of weak-keys on the average DFR has not been fully investigated. Therefore, in this paper, we first perform an implementation of the BIKE scheme, and then through extensive experiments show that the weak-keys can be a potential threat to IND-CCA security of the BIKE scheme and thus need attention from the research community prior to standardization. We also propose a key-check algorithm that can potentially supplement the BIKE mechanism and prevent users from generating and adopting weak keys to address this issue.",

At the same time, practical key exchange protocols based on Diffie-Hellman (DH) or ECDSA primitives are not designed or implemented in a threshold setting. In this paper, we implement popular key exchange protocols in a threshold manner and show that this approach can be used in practice. First, we introduce two basic threshold DH key agreement schemes that provide enhanced security features in comparison with the classic DH primitive: dealerless distributed key generation, threshold shared key computation, and private key shares refreshing. We implemented the proposed DH schemes within WireGuard protocol to demonstrate its effectiveness, efficiency, and usability in practice. The open question is the security of the proposed schemes and their instantiation from the elliptic curves used in key agreement protocols: NIST curves, Russian GOST curves, and Curve25519. Second, we propose an idea of implementing TLS in a threshold setting that can be used instead of Keyless SSL/TLS technology, and provide the measurements of TLS key exchanges based on threshold ECDSA. Even if we don't provide any formal definitions, security analysis, and mathematical proofs, we believe that the ideas and mechanisms suggested in this paper can be interesting and useful. The main intention of the paper is to start discussions and raise awareness of the challenges and problems arising when moving to threshold key exchange protocols.",

We present an energy requirement analysis based on extensive measurements of PQC candidate algorithms on a Cortex M4 - based reference platform. We relate computational (energy) costs of PQC algorithms to their data transmission costs which are expected to increase with new types of public keys and ciphertext messages. The energy, bandwidth, and latency needs of PQC algorithms span several orders of magnitude, which is substantial enough to impact battery life, user experience, and application protocol design. We propose metrics and guidelines for PQC algorithm usage in IoT and mobile systems based on our findings. Our evidence supports the view that fast structured-lattice PQC schemes are the preferred choice for cloud-connected mobile devices in most use cases, even when per-bit data transmission energy cost is relatively high.",

A mostly overlooked but valuable line of solutions is provided by non-commutative algebraic structures, specifically canonical protocols that rely on one-way trapdoor functions (OWTF). Here we develop an algebraic framework who could be applied to different asymmetric protocols like D-H KE (Diffie-Hellman key exchange), Public Key Encryption, Digital Signature, ZKP (zero-knowledge proof) authentication, Oblivious Transfer, Multi-Party Computing, and so on. The trapdoor one-way functions selected are (a) Triple decomposition Problem (TDP) developed by Kurt, where a known element is factored into a product of three unknown factors and (b) a new version of conjugacy search that we refer from now on as Blind Conjugacy Search Problem (BCSP). Our platform structure is the general linear group GL(d,F_p) d-square non-singular matrices of prime field values. We give support to the fact that this framework is cryptographically secure against classical attacks like linear algebra attacks, length-based attacks, side-channel attacks against square (or duplicate) and multiply (or sum) algorithm, high sensitivity to pseudo random deterministic generators, etc. At same time it is immune against quantum attacks (using Grover and Shor), if the size parameters are carefully selected.

      "abstract": "The notion of aggregate signature has been motivated by applications and it enables any user to compress different signatures signed by different signers on different messages into a short signature. Sequential aggregate signature, in turn, is a special kind of aggregate signature that only allows a signer to add his signature into an aggregate signature in sequential order. This latter scheme has applications in diversified settings such as in reducing bandwidth of certificate chains and in secure routing protocols. Lu, Ostrovsky, Sahai, Shacham, and Waters (EUROCRYPT 2006) presented the first sequential aggregate signature scheme in the standard model. The size of their public key, however, is quite large (i.e., the number of group elements is proportional to the security parameter), and therefore, they suggested as an open problem the construction of such a scheme with short keys.   In this paper, we propose the first sequential aggregate signature schemes with short public keys (i.e., a constant number of group elements) in prime order (asymmetric) bilinear groups that are secure under static assumptions in the standard model. Furthermore, our schemes employ a constant number of pairing operations per message signing and message verification operation. Technically, we start with a public-key signature scheme based on the recent dual system encryption technique of Lewko and Waters (TCC 2010). This technique cannot directly provide an aggregate signature scheme since, as we observed, additional elements should be published in a public key to support aggregation. Thus, our constructions are careful augmentation techniques for the dual system technique to allow it to support sequential aggregate signature schemes. We also propose a multi-signature scheme with short public parameters in the standard model.",

In this paper we study a public key cryptosystem based on such polynomials, which provides both encryption and digital signature. The cryptosystem works on real numbers and is quite efficient. Unfortunately, from our analysis it comes up that it is not secure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding plaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce forgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out that also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an authentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are not secure due to the aforementioned attack. We close the paper by discussing the issues and the possibilities of constructing public key cryptosystems on real numbers.",
