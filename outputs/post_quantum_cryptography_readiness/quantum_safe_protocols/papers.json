      "abstract": "We propose a method for using Web Authentication APIs for SSH authentication, enabling passwordless remote server login with passkeys. These are credentials that are managed throughout the key lifecycle by an authenticator on behalf of the user and offer strong security guarantees.   Passwords remain the dominant mode of SSH authentication, despite their well known flaws such as phishing and reuse. SSH's custom key-based authentication protocol can alleviate these issues but remains vulnerable to key theft. Additionally, it has poor usability, with even knowledgeable users leaking key material and failing to verify fingerprints. Hence, effective key management remains a critical open area in SSH security. In contrast, WebAuthn is a modern authentication standard designed to replace passwords, managing keys on behalf of the user. As a web API, this standard cannot integrate with SSH directly.   We propose a framework to integrate WebAuthn with SSH servers, by using UNIX pluggable authentication modules (PAM). Our approach is backwards-compatible, supports stock SSH servers and requires no new software client-side. It offers protection for cryptographic material at rest, resistance to key leaks, phishing protection, privacy protection and attestation capability. None of these properties are offered by passwords nor traditional SSH keys. We validate these advantages with a structured, conceptual security analysis.   We develop a prototype implementation and conduct a user study to quantify the security advantages of our proposal, testing our prototype with 40 SSH users. The study confirms the security problems of SSH-keys, including 20% of the cohort leaking their private keys. Our SSH-passkeys effectively address these problems: we find a 90% reduction in critical security errors, while reducing authentication time by 4x on average.",

      "abstract": "The automotive industry is undergoing a software-as-a-service transformation that enables software-defined functions and post-sale updates via cloud and vehicle-to-everything communication. Connectivity in cars introduces significant security challenges, as remote attacks on vehicles have become increasingly prevalent. Current automotive designs call for security solutions that address the entire lifetime of a vehicle. In this paper, we propose to authenticate and authorize in-vehicle services by integrating DNSSEC, DANE, and DANCE with automotive middleware. Our approach decouples the cryptographic authentication of the service from that of the service deployment with the help of DNSSEC and thereby largely simplifies key management. We propose to authenticate in-vehicle services by certificates that are solely generated by the service suppliers but published on deployment via DNSSEC TLSA records solely signed by the OEM. Building on well-established Internet standards ensures interoperability with various current and future protocols, scalable management of credentials for millions of connected vehicles at well-established security levels. We back our design proposal by a security analysis using the STRIDE threat model and by evaluations in a realistic in-vehicle setup that demonstrate its effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Authentication is a fundamental building block of secure quantum networks, essential for quantum cryptographic protocols and often debated as a key limitation of quantum key distribution (QKD) in security standards. Most quantum-safe authentication schemes rely on small pre-shared keys or post-quantum computational assumptions. In this work, we introduce a new authentication approach that combines hardware assumptions, particularly Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), along with fundamental quantum properties of non-local states, such as local indistinguishability, to achieve provable security in entanglement-based protocols. We propose two protocols for different scenarios in entanglement-enabled quantum networks. The first protocol, referred to as the offline protocol, requires pre-distributed entangled states but no quantum communication during the authentication phase. It enables a server to authenticate clients at any time with only minimal classical communication. The second, an online protocol, requires quantum communication but only necessitates entangled state generation on the prover side. For this, we introduce a novel hardware module, the Hybrid Entangled PUF (HEPUF). Both protocols use weakly secure, off-the-shelf classical PUFs as their hardware module, yet we prove that quantum properties such as local indistinguishability enable exponential security for authentication, even in a single round. We provide full security analysis for both protocols and establish them as the first entanglement-based extension of hardware-based quantum authentication. These protocols are suitable for implementation across various platforms, particularly photonics-based ones, and offer a practical and flexible solution to the long-standing challenge of authentication in quantum communication networks.",

We develop a formal model of TLS RPK using applied pi calculus and the ProVerif verification tool, revealing that the RPK mode is susceptible to identity misbinding attacks.

This prompted researchers to design the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) standard, defined in RFC 6960, to guide developers in implementing OCSP components. However, as the environment increasingly relies on PKI for identity authentication, it is essential to protect the communication between clients and servers from rogue elements. This can be achieved by using SSL/TLS techniques to establish a secure channel, allowing Certificate Authorities (CAs) to safely transfer certificate status information. In this work, we introduce the OCSP Stapling approach to optimize OCSP query costs in our smart grid environment. This approach reduces the number of queries from the Device Language Message Specification (DLMS) server to the OCSP server. Our experimental results show that OCSP stapling increases both efficiency and security, creating a more robust architecture for the smart grid.",

      "abstract": "Authentication in TLS is predominately carried out with X.509 digital certificates issued by certificate authorities (CA). The centralized nature of current public key infrastructures, however, comes along with severe risks, such as single points of failure and susceptibility to cyber-attacks, potentially undermining the security and trustworthiness of the entire system. With Decentralized Identifiers (DID) alongside distributed ledger technology, it becomes technically feasible to prove ownership of a unique identifier without requiring an attestation of the proof's public key by a centralized and therefore vulnerable CA. This article presents DID Link, a novel authentication scheme for TLS 1.3 that empowers entities to authenticate in a TLS-compliant way with self-issued X.509 certificates that are equipped with ledger-anchored DIDs instead of CA-issued identifiers. It facilitates the exchange of tamper-proof and 3rd-party attested claims in the form of DID-bound Verifiable Credentials after the TLS handshake to complete the authentication with a full identification of the communication partner. A prototypical implementation shows comparable TLS handshake durations of DID Link if verification material is cached and reasonable prolongations if it is obtained from a ledger. The significant speed improvement of the resulting TLS channel over a widely used, DID-based alternative transport protocol on the application layer demonstrates the potential of DID Link to become a viable solution for the establishment of secure and trustful end-to-end communication links with decentrally managed digital identities.",

      "abstract": "TLS is extensively utilized for secure data transmission over networks. However, with the advent of quantum computers, the security of TLS based on traditional public-key cryptography is under threat. To counter quantum threats, it is imperative to integrate post-quantum algorithms into TLS. Most PQ-TLS research focuses on integration and evaluation, but few studies address the improvement of PQ-TLS performance by optimizing PQC implementation. For the TLS protocol, handshake performance is crucial, and for post-quantum TLS (PQ-TLS) the performance of post-quantum key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) directly impacts handshake performance. In this work, we explore the impact of post-quantum KEMs on PQ-TLS performance. We explore how to improve ML-KEM performance using the latest Intel's Advanced Vector Extensions instruction set AVX-512. We detail a spectrum of techniques devised to parallelize polynomial multiplication, modular reduction, and other computationally intensive modules within ML-KEM. Our optimized ML-KEM implementation achieves up to 1.64x speedup compared to the latest AVX2 implementation. Furthermore, we introduce a novel batch key generation method for ML-KEM that can seamlessly integrate into the TLS protocols. The batch method accelerates the key generation procedure by 3.5x to 4.9x. We integrate the optimized AVX-512 implementation of ML-KEM into TLS 1.3, and assess handshake performance under both PQ-only and hybrid modes. The assessment demonstrates that our faster ML-KEM implementation results in a higher number of TLS 1.3 handshakes per second under both modes. Additionally, we revisit two IND-1-CCA KEM constructions discussed in Eurocrypt22 and Asiacrypt23. Besides, we implement them based on ML-KEM and integrate the one of better performance into TLS 1.3 with benchmarks.",

It improves safety, increases efficiency and reduces air traffic congestion by broadcasting aircraft navigation data. Yet, ADS-B is vulnerable to spoofing attacks as it lacks mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being supplied. None of the existing cryptographic solutions fully meet the backward compatibility and bandwidth preservation requirements of the standard. Hence, we propose the Compatible Authenticated Bandwidth-efficient Broadcast protocol for ADS-B (CABBA), an improved approach that integrates TESLA, phase-overlay modulation techniques and certificate-based PKI. As a result, entity authentication, data origin authentication, and data integrity are the security services that CABBA offers. To assess compliance with the standard, we designed an SDR-based implementation of CABBA and performed backward compatibility tests on commercial and general aviation (GA) ADS-B in receivers. Besides, we calculated the 1090ES band's activity factor and analyzed the channel occupancy rate according to ITU-R SM.2256-1 recommendation. Also, we performed a bit error rate analysis of CABBA messages. The results suggest that CABBA is backward compatible, does not incur significant communication overhead, and has an error rate that is acceptable for Eb/No values above 14 dB.",

      "abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has improved people's lives by seamlessly integrating into many facets of modern life and facilitating information sharing across platforms. Device Authentication and Key exchange are major challenges for the IoT. High computational resource requirements for cryptographic primitives and message transmission during Authentication make the existing methods like PKI and IBE not suitable for these resource constrained devices. PUF appears to offer a practical and economical security mechanism in place of typically sophisticated cryptosystems like PKI and IBE. PUF provides an unclonable and tamper sensitive unique signature based on the PUF chip by using manufacturing process variability. Therefore, in this study, we use lightweight bitwise XOR, hash function, and PUF to Authenticate IoT devices. Despite several studies employing the PUF to authenticate communication between IoT devices, to the authors' knowledge, existing solutions require intermediary gateway and internet capabilities by the IoT device to directly interact with a Server for Authentication and hence, are not scalable when the IoT device works on different technologies like BLE, Zigbee, etc. To address the aforementioned issue, we present a system in which the IoT device does not require a continuous active internet connection to communicate with the server in order to Authenticate itself. The results of a thorough security study are validated against adversarial attacks and PUF modeling attacks. For formal security validation, the AVISPA verification tool is also used. Performance study recommends this protocol's lightweight characteristics. The proposed protocol's acceptability and defenses against adversarial assaults are supported by a prototype developed with ESP32.",

      "abstract": "The centralized PKI is not a suitable solution to provide identities in large-scale IoT systems. The main problem is the high cost of managing X.509 certificates throughout their lifecycle, from installation to regular updates and revocation. The Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a decentralised option that reduces the need for human intervention, and therefore has the potential to significantly reduce the complexity and cost associated to identity management in large-scale IoT systems. However, to leverage the full potential of SSI, the authentication of IoT nodes needs to be moved from the application to the Transport Layer Security (TLS) level. This paper contributes to the adoption of SSI in large-scale IoT systems by addressing, for the first time, the extension of the original TLS 1.3 handshake to support two new SSI authentication modes while maintaining the interoperability with nodes implementing the original handshake protocol. The open source implementation of the new TLS 1.3 handshake protocol in OpenSSL is used to experimentally prove the feasibility of the approach.",

The process is commonly known as eSIM, and it is expected to replace removable SIM cards. The security of the protocol is critical because the profile includes the credentials with which the mobile device will authenticate to the mobile network. In this paper, we present a formal security analysis of the consumer RSP protocol. We model the multi-party protocol in applied pi calculus, define formal security goals, and verify them in ProVerif. The analysis shows that the consumer RSP protocol protects against a network adversary when all the intended participants are honest. However, we also model the protocol in realistic partial compromise scenarios where the adversary controls a legitimate participant or communication channel. The security failures in the partial compromise scenarios reveal weaknesses in the protocol design. The most important observation is that the security of RSP depends unnecessarily on it being encapsulated in a TLS tunnel. Also, the lack of pre-established identifiers means that a compromised download server anywhere in the world or a compromised secure element can be used for attacks against RSP between honest participants. Additionally, the lack of reliable methods for verifying user intent can lead to serious security failures. Based on the findings, we recommend practical improvements to RSP implementations, future versions of the specification, and mobile operator processes to increase the robustness of eSIM security.",

If upon establishing a new connection, the presented server key is unknown to the client, the user is asked to verify the key fingerprint manually, which is prone to errors and often blindly trusted. The SSH standard describes an alternative to such manual key verification: using the Domain Name System (DNS) to publish the server key information in SSHFP records.   In this paper, we conduct a large-scale Internet study to measure the prevalence of SSHFP records among DNS domain names. We scan the Tranco 1M list and over 500 million names from the certificate transparency log over the course of 26 days. The results show that in two studied populations, about 1 in 10,000 domains has SSHFP records, with more than half of them deployed without using DNSSEC, drastically reducing security benefits.",

The most general design used in email transmission architecture is SMTP with PGP/GPG encryption sending through an TLS/SSL secure channel. Regardless, vulnerabilities within these security protocols and encryption methods, there is still work can be done regarding the architecture design.

      "abstract": "The standardized Authentication and Key Agreement protocol for 5G networks (5G AKA) have several security and privacy vulnerabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel authentication and key agreement protocol for 5G and beyond that is compatible with the standardized 5G AKA. Our protocol has several privacy and security properties, e.g., perfect forward secrecy, resistance against linkability attacks, and protection against malicious SNs. Moreover, both the user identity protection and the perfect forward secrecy are handled using Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEM), which makes our protocol adaptable to the quantum-safe setting. To analyze the performance of the proposed protocol, we use the post-quantum KEM CRYSTALS-Kyber, recently chosen to be standardized by NIST, and NIST post-quantum Round 4 candidate KEMs. The results for communication and computation costs show that utilizing our protocol is feasible in practice and sometimes outperforms the public-key cryptography used in 5G AKA, i.e., ECIES. We further prove the security of our protocol by utilizing ProVerif.",

      "abstract": "Smart grids are intelligent power transmission networks that monitor and control communication participants and grid nodes to ensure bidirectional flow of information and power between all nodes. To secure the smart grid, it is very important to design the key agreement protocol. The pairing-free certificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocol has been widely studied and applied as a basic core protocol to protect the security of the smart grid. Until now, various protocols have been proposed, and these protocols are being introduced and operated not only in smart grid, but also in smart cities, healthcare, and vehicle ad hoc networks. In this paper, we analyzed the security properties of two recently proposed pairing-free certificateless two-party authenticated key agreement protocols for Smart grid. According to our analysis, these two protocols are insecure against basic impersonation attacks of malicious key-generator centers, man-in-the-middle attacks of malicious key generator centers, and key offset attacks. We also found and pointed out some errors in the descriptions of these protocols.",

We analyse the Payment Protocol confirming that it is vulnerable to an attack violating the refund address authentication security goal. Moreover, we present a concrete protocol revision proposal supporting the merchant with publicly verifiable evidence that can mitigate the attack.

As the widespread adoption of HTTPS protocol has made it difficult to classify the traffic looking into the content field, one of the fields the middle-boxes look for is Server Name Indicator (SNI), which goes in plain text. SNI field contains information about the host and can, in turn, reveal the type of traffic. This paper presents a method to mask the server host identity by encrypting the SNI. We develop a simple method that completes the SSL/TLS connection establishment over two handshakes - the first handshake establishes a secure channel without sharing SNI information, and the second handshake shares the encrypted SNI. Our method makes it mandatory for fronting servers to always accept the handshake request without the SNI and respond with a valid SSL certificate.   As there is no modification in already proven SSL/TLS encryption mechanism and processing of handshake messages, the new method enjoys all security benefits of existing secure channel establishment and needs no modification in existing routers/middle-boxes. Using customized client-server over the live Internet, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Moreover, the impact analysis shows that the method adheres to almost all SSL/TLS related Internet standards requirements.",

      "abstract": "Forward Secrecy (FS) is a security property in key-exchange algorithms which guarantees that a compromise in the secrecy of a long-term private-key does not compromise the secrecy of past session keys. With a growing awareness of long-term mass surveillance programs by governments and others, FS has become widely regarded as a highly desirable property. This is particularly true in the TLS protocol, which is used to secure Internet communication. In this paper, we investigate FS in pre-TLS 1.3 protocols, which do not mandate FS, but still widely used today. We conduct an empirical analysis of over 10 million TLS servers from three different datasets using a novel heuristic approach. Using a modern TLS client handshake algorithms, our results show 5.37% of top domains, 7.51% of random domains, and 26.16% of random IPs do not select FS key-exchange algorithms. Surprisingly, 39.20% of the top domains, 24.40% of the random domains, and 14.46% of the random IPs that do not select FS, do support FS. In light of this analysis, we discuss possible paths toward forward secure Internet traffic. As an improvement of the current state, we propose a new client-side mechanism that we call \"Best Effort Forward Secrecy\" (BEFS), and an extension of it that we call \"Best Effort Forward Secrecy and Authenticated Encryption\" (BESAFE), which aims to guide (force) misconfigured servers to FS using a best effort approach. Finally, within our analysis, we introduce a novel adversarial model that we call \"discriminatory\" adversary, which is applicable to the TLS protocol.",

      "abstract": "RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a powerful technology that, due to its numerous advantages, is supposed to replace the various identification systems such as barcodes or magnetic stripes in a short time. There are three devices involved in an RFID protocol: a Reader, a Tag, and a back-end Database. One of the key factors for the RFID technology is that, in order to be used on large scale, the price of the Tags has to be cheap: it cannot be expensive because who is supposed to use it would need a great amount of them, furthermore, Tags must have very small dimensions. The low-cost nature of such devices implies the impossibility to use standard cryptographic protocols on them, furthermore, Ultra-Lightweight Tags even lack the necessary computational power to generate random numbers. Many experts are trying to build secure protocols that involve just simple bitwise logical operations for these Tags, but, unfortunately, each of these protocols turned out to be vulnerable to some serious attack after short time from publication. The need for a secure RFID authentication protocol today seems more urgent than ever, because this technology is already used for security purposes, such as electronic passports. The challenge to build a secure protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems is so hard that in several years no one has been able to build one. In this thesis we analyze in great detail a recently proposed protocol for Ultra-Lightweight RFID systems called SLAP, with the aim of finding new vulnerabilities. SLAP has already been violated (along with a set of similar protocols) by Safkhani and Bagheri, that have recently published a de-synchronization attack. At the end of our analysis, we will propose an impersonification attack to the protocol, along with a fix for our attack and some considerations on the attacks proposed on this kind of protocols.",

This calls for formal and automated verification techniques that exhaustively explore all possible intruder behaviors and that scale well.   The symbolic approach offers rigorous, mathematical frameworks and automated tools to analyze security protocols. Based on well-designed abstractions, it has allowed for large-scale formal analyses of real-life protocols such as TLS 1.3 and mobile telephony protocols. Hence a natural question is: Can we use this successful line of work to analyze quantum protocols? This paper proposes a first positive answer and motivates further research on this unexplored path.",

However, there are known performance issues, making it unsuitable for use in vehicular networks. In this paper, we propose a secure and authenticated key management protocol (SA-KMP) to overcome the shortcomings of the PKI. The SA-KMP scheme distributes repository containing the bindings of the en-tity's identity and its corresponding public key to each vehicle and road side unit. By doing so, certificate exchanges and certificate revocation lists are eliminated. Furthermore, the SA-KMP scheme uses symmetric keys derived based on a 3-D-matrix-based key agreement scheme to reduce the high computational costs of using asymmetric cryptography. We demonstrate the efficiency of the SA-KMP through performance evaluations in terms of transmission and storage overhead, network latency, and key generation time. Analytical results show that the SA-KMP is more scalable and outperforms the certificate-based PKI. Simulation results indicate that the key generation time of the SA-KMP scheme is less than that of the existing Elliptic Curve Diffie--Hellman and Diffie--Hellman protocols. In addition, we use Proverif to prove that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against an active attacker under the Dolev and Yao model and further show that the SA-KMP scheme is secure against denial of service, collusion attacks, and a wide range of other malicious attacks.",

      "abstract": "Authentication is one of the essential security services in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for ensuring secure data sessions. Sensor node authentication ensures the confidentiality and validity of data collected by the sensor node, whereas user authentication guarantees that only legitimate users can access the sensor data. In a mobile WSN, sensor and user nodes move across the network and exchange data with multiple nodes, thus experiencing the authentication process multiple times. The integration of WSNs with Internet of Things (IoT) brings forth a new kind of WSN architecture along with stricter security requirements; for instance, a sensor node or a user node may need to establish multiple concurrent secure data sessions. With concurrent data sessions, the frequency of the re-authentication process increases in proportion to the number of concurrent connections, which makes the security issue even more challenging. The currently available authentication protocols were designed for the autonomous WSN and do not account for the above requirements. In this paper, we present a novel, lightweight and efficient key exchange and authentication protocol suite called the Secure Mobile Sensor Network (SMSN) Authentication Protocol. In the SMSN a mobile node goes through an initial authentication procedure and receives a re-authentication ticket from the base station. Later a mobile node can use this re-authentication ticket when establishing multiple data exchange sessions and/or when moving across the network. This scheme reduces the communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. We proved the strength of our protocol with rigorous security analysis and simulated the SMSN and previously proposed schemes in an automated protocol verifier tool. Finally, we compared the computational complexity and communication cost against well-known authentication protocols.",

TAP improves the security of protocols with the assistance of time-based encryption keys and scales down the authentication complexity by issuing a re-authentication ticket. While moving across the network, a mobile customer node sends a re-authentication ticket to establish new sessions with service-providing nodes. Consequently, this reduces the communication and computational complexity of the authentication process. In the keying protocol suite, a key distributor controls the key generation arguments and time factors, while other participants independently generate a keychain based on key generation arguments.

At the same time, to avoid the attacker to attack the legal vehicle by RSU, we adopt deniable group key agreement method to negotiation session key (sk) and use it to transmit GK between RSU. In addition, vehicles not only broadcast messages to other vehicles, but also communicate with other members in the same group. So group communication is necessary in VANET.

      "abstract": "The majority of electronic communication today happens either via email or chat. Thanks to the use of standardised protocols electronic mail (SMTP, IMAP, POP3) and instant chat (XMPP, IRC) servers can be deployed in a decentralised but interoperable fashion. These protocols can be secured by providing encryption with the use of TLS---directly or via the STARTTLS extension---and leverage X.509 PKIs or ad hoc methods to authenticate communication peers. However, many combination of these mechanisms lead to insecure deployments.   We present the largest study to date that investigates the security of the email and chat infrastructures. We used active Internet-wide scans to determine the amount of secure service deployments, and passive monitoring to investigate if user agents actually use this opportunity to secure their communications. We addressed both the client-to-server interactions as well as server-to-server forwarding mechanisms that these protocols offer, and the use of encryption and authentication methods in the process.   Our findings shed light on an insofar unexplored area of the Internet. The truly frightening result is that most of our communication is poorly secured in transit.",

Secondly, we develop an algorithm for verifying security properties by utilizing the key ingredients of the first-order reasoning for reachability analysis, while tracking state transformation and checking the validity of newly generated states. Our verification algorithm is proven to be (partially) correct, if it terminates. We have implemented the proposed framework and verification algorithms in a tool named SSPA, and evaluate it using a number of stateful security protocols. The experimental results show that our approach is not only feasible but also practically efficient.

      "abstract": "Privacy preserving RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) authentication has been an active research area in recent years. Both forward security and backward security are required to maintain the privacy of a tag, i.e., exposure of a tag's secret key should not reveal the past or future secret keys of the tag. We envisage the need for a formal model for backward security for RFID protocol designs in shared key settings, since the RFID tags are too resource-constrained to support public key settings. However, there has not been much research on backward security for shared key environment since Serge Vaudenay in his Asiacrypt 2007 paper showed that perfect backward security is impossible to achieve without public key settings. We propose a Privacy Preserving RFID Authentication Protocol for shared key environment, APRAP, which minimizes the damage caused by secret key exposure using insulated keys. Even if a tag's secret key is exposed during an authentication session, forward security and 'restricted' backward security of the tag are preserved under our assumptions. The notion of 'restricted' backward security is that the adversary misses the protocol transcripts which are needed to update the compromised secret key. Although our definition does not capture perfect backward security, it is still suitable for effective implementation as the tags are highly mobile in practice. We also provide a formal security model of APRAP. Our scheme is more efficient than previous proposals from the viewpoint of computational requirements.",

      "abstract": "Mobile IPv6 control signalling messages generally act as informants to the home agent (HA) and the correspondent node (CN) regarding a mobile node's (MN's) new address when its network attachment point changes. Messages should be protected to avoid different security attacks. In the existing standard, control signalling messages between HA and MN are frequently authenticated with IKEv2 and X.509 certificates via IPSec. These signalling messages between MN and CN are so far protected by an effective but insecure protocol. A protocol that uses Binding Update Route Optimisation has security vulnerabilities that allow redirection of traffic by attackers. This traffic is intercepted and then false binding updates is sent along with packet eavesdropping and Denial of Service (DoS) that disrupts any communication. Due to lack of ineffective authentication procedures to ascertain the validity of the users or hide the location data of HoA and CoA, security issues mentioned above will occur. This paper presents some of existing protecting control signalling message protocols, as well as some proposed approaches for designing a secure method-based private key IP address between an MN and a CN. Using Private Key Based Binding Update (PKBU), care-of-address (CoA) can thus be protected against False Binding Update (FBU), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) and Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks.",

      "abstract": "Key establishment is a crucial primitive for building secure channels: in a multi-party setting, it allows two parties using only public authenticated communication to establish a secret session key which can be used to encrypt messages. But if the session key is compromised, the confidentiality of encrypted messages is typically compromised as well. Without quantum mechanics, key establishment can only be done under the assumption that some computational problem is hard. Since digital communication can be easily eavesdropped and recorded, it is important to consider the secrecy of information anticipating future algorithmic and computational discoveries which could break the secrecy of past keys, violating the secrecy of the confidential channel.   Quantum key distribution (QKD) can be used generate secret keys that are secure against any future algorithmic or computational improvements. QKD protocols still require authentication of classical communication, however, which is most easily achieved using computationally secure digital signature schemes. It is generally considered folklore that QKD when used with computationally secure authentication is still secure against an unbounded adversary, provided the adversary did not break the authentication during the run of the protocol.   We describe a security model for quantum key distribution based on traditional classical authenticated key exchange (AKE) security models. Using our model, we characterize the long-term security of the BB84 QKD protocol with computationally secure authentication against an eventually unbounded adversary. By basing our model on traditional AKE models, we can more readily compare the relative merits of various forms of QKD and existing classical AKE protocols. This comparison illustrates in which types of adversarial environments different quantum and classical key agreement protocols can be secure.",

Our work is the first formal analysis to consider messages that are sent in the core network, where we take into account details of the carrying protocol (i.e., MAP or Diameter) and of the mechanism for secure transport (i.e., MAPsec/TCAPsec or IPsec ESP). Moreover, we report on a deficiency in the protocol specifications of UMTS AKA and LTE AKA and the specifications of the core network security (called network domain security), which may enable efficient attacks. The vulnerability allows an inside attacker not only to impersonate an honest protocol participant during a run of the protocol but also to subsequently use wireless services on his behalf. UMTS AKA run over MAP with MAPsec seems vulnerable in the most straight-forward application of the attack. On the other hand, our analysis shows that UMTS and LTE AKA over Diameter/IPsec and UMTS AKA over MAP/TCAPsec (with sufficiently long session identifiers) computationally satisfy intended authentication properties as well as some key secrecy properties, assuming that the used primitives meet standard cryptographic assumptions.",

However, the efforts to improve IPSec are still under way; one aspect of this improvement is to take Quality of Service (QoS) requirements into account. QoS is the ability of the network to provide a service at an assured service level while optimizing the global usage of network resources. The QoS level that a flow receives depends on a six-bit identifier in the IP header; the so-called Differentiated Services code point (DSCP). Basically, Multi-Field classifiers classify a packet by inspecting IP/TCP headers, to decide how the packet should be processed. The current IPSec standard does hardly offer any guidance to do this, because the existing IPSec ESP security protocol hides much of this information in its encrypted payloads, preventing network control devices such as routers and switches from utilizing this information in performing classification appropriately. To solve this problem, we propose a QoS-friendly Encapsulated Security Payload (Q-ESP) as a new IPSec security protocol that provides both security and QoS supports. We also present our NetBSD kernel-based implementation as well as our evaluation results of Q-ESP.",
