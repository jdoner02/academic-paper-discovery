      "abstract": "Organizations have to plan on migrating to quantum-resilient cryptographic measures, also known as PQC. However, this is a difficult task, and to the best of our knowledge, there is no generalized approach to manage such a complex migration for cryptography used in IT systems that explicitly integrates into organizations' steering mechanisms and control systems. We present PMMP, a risk-based process for managing the migration of organizations from classic cryptography to PQC and establishing crypto-agility. Having completed the initial design phase, as well as a theoretical evaluation, we now intend to promote PMMP. Practitioners are encouraged to join the effort in order to enable a comprehensive practical evaluation and further development.",

      "abstract": "The implications of sufficiently large quantum computers for widely used public-key cryptography is well-documented and increasingly discussed by the security community. An April 2016 report by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), notably, calls out the need for new standards to replace cryptosystems based on integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems, which have been shown to be vulnerable to Shor's quantum algorithm for prime factorization. Specifically, widely used RSA, ECDSA, ECDH, and DSA cryptosystems will need to be replaced by post-quantum cryptography (PQC) alternatives (also known as quantum-resistant or quantum-safe cryptography). Failure to transition before sufficiently powerful quantum computers are realized will jeopardize the security of public key cryptosystems which are widely deployed within communication protocols, digital signing mechanisms, authentication frameworks, and more. To avoid this, NIST has actively led a PQC standardization effort since 2016, leveraging a large and international research community.   On January 31-February 1, 2019, the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held a workshop in Washington, D.C. to discuss research challenges associated with PQC migration. Entitled, \"Identifying Research Challenges in Post Quantum Cryptography Migration and Cryptographic Agility\", participants came from three distinct yet related communities: cryptographers contributing to the NIST PQC standards effort, applied cryptographers with expertise in creating cryptographic solutions and implementing cryptography in real-world settings, and industry practitioners with expertise in deploying cryptographic standards within products and compute infrastructures. Discussion centered around two key themes: identifying constituent challenges in PQC migration and imagining a new science of \"cryptographic agility\".",

      "abstract": "The advent of quantum computing poses a significant challenge as it has the potential to break certain cryptographic algorithms, necessitating a proactive approach to identify and modernize cryptographic code. Identifying these cryptographic elements in existing code is only the first step. It is crucial not only to identify quantum vulnerable algorithms but also to detect vulnerabilities and incorrect crypto usages, to prioritize, report, monitor as well as remediate and modernize code bases. A U.S. government memorandum require agencies to begin their transition to PQC (Post Quantum Cryptograpy) by conducting a prioritized inventory of cryptographic systems including software and hardware systems. In this paper we describe our code scanning tool - Cryptoscope - which leverages cryptographic domain knowledge as well as compiler techniques to statically parse and analyze source code. By analyzing control and data flow the tool is able to build an extendable and querriable inventory of cryptography. Cryptoscope goes beyond identifying disconnected cryptographic APIs and instead provides the user with an inventory of cryptographic assets - containing comprehensive views of the cryptographic operations implemented. We show that for more than 92% of our test cases, these views include the cryptographic operation itself, APIs, as well as the related material such as keys, nonces, random sources etc. Lastly, building on top of this inventory, our tool is able to detect and report all the cryptographic related weaknesses and vulnerabilities (11 out of 15) in CamBench - achieving state-of-the-art performance.",

We also provide numerical data for selected parameter sets. Furthermore, we analyze the proposed model in terms of real-world patterns and its practical applicability.

      "abstract": "The problem of adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic network protocols or post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is critically important to democratizing quantum computing. The problem is urgent because practical quantum computers will break classical encryption in the next few decades. Past encrypted data has already been collected and can be decrypted in the near future. The main challenges of adopting post-quantum cryptography lie in algorithmic complexity and hardware/software/network implementation. The grand question of how existing cyberinfrastructure will support post-quantum cryptography remains unanswered.   This paper describes: i) the design of a novel Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) network instrument placed at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and a part of the FABRIC testbed; ii) the latest results on PQC adoption rate across a wide spectrum of network protocols (Secure Shell -- SSH, Transport Layer Security -- TLS, etc.); iii) the current state of PQC implementation in key scientific applications (e.g., OpenSSH or SciTokens); iv) the challenges of being quantum-resistant; and v) discussion of potential novel attacks.   This is the first large-scale measurement of PQC adoption at national-scale supercomputing centers and FABRIC testbeds. Our results show that only OpenSSH and Google Chrome have successfully implemented PQC and achieved an initial adoption rate of 0.029% (6,044 out of 20,556,816) for OpenSSH connections at NCSA coming from major Internet Service Providers or Autonomous Systems (ASes) such as OARNET, GTT, Google Fiber Webpass (U.S.) and Uppsala Lans Landsting (Sweden), with an overall increasing adoption rate year-over-year for 2023-2024.

A gap is identified in available open-source solutions, particularly for the generation and validation of hybrid and composite certificates via command-line interfaces. To address this, a proof-of-concept implementation based on the Bouncy Castle library is developed. The tool supports the creation of classical, hybrid (Catalyst), composite, and partially chameleon certificates using PQC algorithms such as ML-DSA and SLH-DSA. It demonstrates compatibility with standard X.509 workflows and aims to support headless operation and constrained platforms typical of industrial systems. The implementation is modular, publicly available, and intended to facilitate further research and testing of PQC migration strategies in practice. A comparison with OpenSSL-based solutions highlights current limitations in standardization, toolchain support, and algorithm coverage.",

      "abstract": "The rise of large-scale quantum computing poses a significant threat to traditional cryptographic security measures. Quantum attacks undermine current asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, rendering them ineffective. Even symmetric key cryptography is vulnerable, albeit to a lesser extent, suggesting longer keys or extended hash functions for security. Thus, current cryptographic solutions are inadequate against emerging quantum threats. Organizations must transition to quantum-safe environments with robust continuity plans and meticulous risk management. This study explores the challenges of migrating to quantum-safe cryptographic states, introducing a comprehensive security risk assessment framework. We propose a security risk assessment framework that examines vulnerabilities across algorithms, certificates, and protocols throughout the migration process (pre-migration, during migration, post-migration). We link these vulnerabilities to the STRIDE threat model to assess their impact and likelihood. Then, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for critical components like algorithms, public key infrastructures, and protocols. Our study not only identifies potential attacks and vulnerabilities at each layer and migration stage but also suggests possible countermeasures and alternatives to enhance system resilience, empowering organizations to construct a secure infrastructure for the quantum era. Through these efforts, we establish the foundation for enduring security in networked systems amid the challenges of the quantum era.",

A semi-synthetic dataset, consisting of key features such as key size, network complexity, and sensitivity levels, is crafted, with each configuration labeled according to its recommended mitigation plan. Using decision tree and random forest models, a classifier is trained to recommend appropriate mitigation/transition plans such as continuous monitoring, scheduled transitions, and immediate hybrid implementation.

Traditional cryptographic algorithms, foundational to digital signatures, message encryption, and hashing functions, become vulnerable to the immense computational power of quantum computers.

By elucidating the intricate challenges and strategic considerations inherent in transitioning to quantum-resistant algorithms, the paper evaluates risks and highlights obstacles in securing blockchain components with quantum-resistant cryptography. It offers a hybrid migration strategy to facilitate a smooth transition from classical to quantum-resistant cryptography. The analysis extends to prominent blockchains such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, and Zcash, assessing vulnerable components, potential impacts, and associated STRIDE threats, thereby identifying areas susceptible to quantum attacks. Beyond analysis, the paper provides actionable guidance for designing secure and resilient blockchain ecosystems in the quantum computing era. Recognizing the looming threat of quantum computers, this research advocates for a proactive transition to quantum-resistant blockchain networks. It proposes a tailored security blueprint that strategically fortifies each component against the evolving landscape of quantum-induced cyber threats.

The inherent characteristics such as scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency of serverless computing, attracted many companies to migrate their legacy applications toward this paradigm. However, the stateless nature of serverless requires careful migration planning, consideration of its subsequent implications, and potential challenges. To this end, this study investigates the intentions, strategies, and technical and organizational challenges while migrating to a serverless architecture. We investigated the migration processes of 11 systems across diverse domains by conducting 15 in-depth interviews with professionals from 11 organizations. we also presented a detailed discussion of each migration case. Our findings reveal that large enterprises primarily migrate to enhance scalability and operational efficiency, while smaller organizations intend to reduce the cost. Furthermore, organizations use a domain-driven design approach to identify the use case and gradually migrate to serverless using a strangler pattern. However, migration encounters technical challenges i.e., testing event-driven architecture, integrating with the legacy system, lack of standardization, and organizational challenges i.e., mindset change and hiring skilled serverless developers as a prominent. The findings of this study provide a comprehensive understanding that can guide future implementations and advancements in the context of serverless migration.",

      "abstract": "Context: A Legacy system can be defined as a system that significantly resists modification and evolution. According to the literature, there are two main strategies to migrate a legacy system: (a) to replace the legacy system by a new one, (b) to incrementally migrate parts from the legacy system to the new one. Incremental migration allows developers to better control the risks that may occur during the migration process. However, this strategy is more complex because it requires decomposition of the legacy system into different parts, e.g. a set of files, and to define the order of migration of them along the migration process. To our knowledge, there is no approach to support developers on those activities. Objective: This paper presents an approach, named MigrationExp, to support incremental language migrations of applications from one source language to another target language. MigrationExp recommends the files that should be migrated first in a particular migration iteration. As a novelty, our approach relies on a ranking model learned, using a learning-to-rank algorithm, from migrations made by developers. Method: We validate our approach in the context of the migrations of Android apps, from Java to Kotlin, a new official language for Android. We train our model using migrations of Java code to Kotlin written by developers on open-source applications. Results: The results show that, on the task of proposing files to migrate, our approach outperforms a previous migration strategy proposed by Google, in terms of its ability to accurately predict empirically observed migration orders. Conclusion: Since most Android applications are written in Java, we conclude that approaches to support developers such as MigrationExp may significantly impact the development of Android applications.",

      "abstract": "Edge computing has become critical for enabling latency-sensitive applications, especially when paired with cloud resources to form cloud-assisted edge clusters. However, efficient resource management remains challenging due to edge nodes' limited capacity and unreliable connectivity. This paper introduces KubeDSM, a Kubernetes-based dynamic scheduling and migration framework tailored for cloud-assisted edge environments. KubeDSM addresses the challenges of resource fragmentation, dynamic scheduling, and live migration while ensuring Quality of Service (QoS) for latency-sensitive applications. Unlike Kubernetes' default scheduler, KubeDSM adopts batch scheduling to minimize resource fragmentation and incorporates a live migration mechanism to optimize edge resource utilization. Specifically, KubeDSM facilitates three key operations: intra-edge migration to reduce fragmentation, edge-to-cloud migration during resource shortages, and cloud-to-edge migration when resources become available, thereby increasing the number of pods allocated to the edge. Our results demonstrate that KubeDSM consistently achieves a higher average edge ratio and a lower standard deviation in edge ratios, highlighting its ability to provide more effective and stable scheduling across different deployments. We also explore the impact of migration strategies and Quality of Service (QoS) configurations on the edge ratios achieved by KubeDSM. The findings reveal that enabling migrations significantly enhances the edge ratio by reducing fragmentation. Additionally, KubeDSM's adaptability in respecting QoS requirements while maximizing overall edge ratios is confirmed through different QoS scenarios.",

Preliminary evaluations suggest that BACIP could enhance verification efficiency and bolster security against tampering and unauthorized access. While the theoretical framework and practical implementations have laid a solid foundation, the protocol's real-world efficacy awaits empirical validation in a production environment. Future research will focus on deploying a prototype, establishing robust validation policies, and defining precise testing parameters.

      "abstract": "The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive, multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly reduces deployment latency and migration costs.",

      "abstract": "After freezing the first phase of the fifth generation of wireless networks (5G) standardization, it finally goes live now and the rollout of the commercial launch (most in fixed 5G broadband services) and migration has been started. However, some challenges are arising in the deployment, integration of each technology, and the interoperability in the network of the communication service providers (CSPs). At the same time, the evolution of 5G is not clear and many questions arise such as whether 5G has long-term evolution or when 5G will change to a next-generation one. This paper provides long-term migration options and paths towards 5G considering many key factors such as the cost, local/national data traffic, marketing, and the standardization trends in the radio access network (RAN), the transport network (TN), the core network (CN), and E2E network. Moreover, we outline some 5G evolution road maps emphasizing on the technologies, standards, and service time lines. The proposed migration paths can be the answer to some CSPs concerns about how to do long-term migration to 5G and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Quantum computing is emerging as a significant threat to information protected by widely used cryptographic systems. Cryptographic methods, once deemed secure for decades, are now at risk of being compromised, posing a massive threat to the security of sensitive data and communications across enterprises worldwide. As a result, there is an urgent need to migrate to quantum-resistant cryptographic systems. This is no simple task. Migrating to a quantum-safe state is a complex process, and many organisations lack the in-house expertise to navigate this transition without guidance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive framework designed to assist enterprises with this migration. Our framework outlines essential steps involved in the cryptographic migration process, and leverages existing organisational inventories. The framework facilitates the efficient identification of cryptographic assets and can be integrated with other enterprise frameworks smoothly. To underscore its practicality and effectiveness, we have incorporated case studies that utilise graph-theoretic techniques to pinpoint and assess cryptographic dependencies. This is useful in prioritising crypto-systems for replacement.",

      "abstract": "With the promise of accelerating software development, low-code platforms (LCPs) are becoming popular across various industries. Nevertheless, there are still barriers hindering their adoption. Among them, vendor lock-in is a major concern, especially considering the lack of interoperability between these platforms. Typically, after modeling an application in one LCP, migrating to another requires starting from scratch remodeling everything (the data model, the graphical user interface, workflows, etc.), in the new platform.   To overcome this situation, this work proposes an approach to improve the interoperability of LCPs by (semi)automatically migrating models specified in one platform to another one. The concrete migration path depends on the capabilities of the source and target tools. We first analyze popular LCPs, characterize their import and export alternatives and define transformations between those data formats when available. This is then complemented with an LLM-based solution, where image recognition features of large language models are employed to migrate models based on a simple image export of the model at hand. The full pipelines are implemented on top of the BESSER modeling framework that acts as a pivot representation between the tools.",

      "abstract": "Air-ground integrated networks can relieve communication pressure on ground transportation networks and provide 6G-enabled vehicular Metaverses services offloading in remote areas with sparse RoadSide Units (RSUs) coverage and downtown areas where users have a high demand for vehicular services. Vehicle Twins (VTs) are the digital twins of physical vehicles to enable more immersive and realistic vehicular services, which can be offloaded and updated on RSU, to manage and provide vehicular Metaverses services to passengers and drivers. The high mobility of vehicles and the limited coverage of RSU signals necessitate VT migration to ensure service continuity when vehicles leave the signal coverage of RSUs. However, uneven VT task migration might overload some RSUs, which might result in increased service latency, and thus impactive immersive experiences for users. In this paper, we propose a dynamic Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted VT migration framework in air-ground integrated networks, where UAVs act as aerial edge servers to assist ground RSUs during VT task offloading. In this framework, we propose a diffusion-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm, which can efficiently make immersive VT migration decisions in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. To balance the workload of RSUs and improve VT migration quality, we design a novel dynamic path planning algorithm based on a heuristic search strategy for UAVs. Simulation results show that the diffusion-based RL algorithm with UAV-assisted performs better than other baseline schemes.",

      "abstract": "The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to the foundational cryptographic algorithms that secure modern digital communications. Protocols such as HTTPS, digital certificates, and public key infrastructures (PKIs) heavily rely on cryptographic primitives like RSA, ECC, and Diffie-Hellman, which are vulnerable to quantum attacks -- most notably Shor's algorithm. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative analysis between classical cryptographic algorithms currently in widespread use and emerging post-quantum cryptographic schemes designed to withstand quantum adversaries. We review the cryptographic mechanisms underpinning modern internet security, outline the mathematical foundations of quantum attacks, and evaluate the security, performance, and implementation feasibility of quantum-resistant alternatives such as Kyber, Dilithium, and Falcon. Additionally, we assess the hybrid approaches currently being explored by institutions and tech companies to enable a smooth transition to post-quantum cryptography. By providing an in-depth comparison, this study aims to guide researchers, developers, and policymakers in understanding the critical implications of quantum computing on cryptographic infrastructures and the necessary steps for securing communications in the quantum era.",

      "abstract": "Public cloud services are integral to modern software development, offering scalability and flexibility to organizations. Based on customer requests, a large-scale product development organization considered migrating the microservice-based product deployments of a large customer to a public cloud provider.   We conducted an exploratory single-case study, utilizing quantitative and qualitative data analysis to understand how and why deployment costs would change when transitioning the product from a private to a public cloud environment while preserving the software architecture. We also isolated the major factors driving the changes in deployment costs.   We found that switching to the customer-chosen public cloud provider would increase costs by up to 50\\%, even when sharing some resources between deployments, and limiting the use of expensive cloud services such as security log analyzers. A large part of the cost was related to the sizing and license costs of the existing relational database, which was running on Virtual Machines in the cloud. We also found that existing system integrators, using the product via its API, were likely to use the product inefficiently, in many cases causing at least 10\\% more load to the system than needed.   From a deployment cost perspective, successful migration to a public cloud requires considering the entire system architecture, including services like relational databases, value-added cloud services, and enabled product features. Our study highlights the importance of leveraging end-to-end usage data to assess and manage these cost drivers effectively, especially in environments with elastic costs, such as public cloud deployments.",

      "abstract": "The financial sector faces escalating cyber threats amplified by artificial intelligence (AI) and the advent of quantum computing. AI is being weaponized for sophisticated attacks like deepfakes and AI-driven malware, while quantum computing threatens to render current encryption methods obsolete. This report analyzes these threats, relevant frameworks, and possible countermeasures like quantum cryptography. AI enhances social engineering and phishing attacks via personalized content, lowers entry barriers for cybercriminals, and introduces risks like data poisoning and adversarial AI. Quantum computing, particularly Shor's algorithm, poses a fundamental threat to current encryption standards (RSA and ECC), with estimates suggesting cryptographically relevant quantum computers could emerge within the next 5-30 years. The \"harvest now, decrypt later\" scenario highlights the urgency of transitioning to quantum-resistant cryptography. This is key. Existing legal frameworks are evolving to address AI in cybercrime, but quantum threats require new initiatives. International cooperation and harmonized regulations are crucial. Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) offers theoretical security but faces practical limitations. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a promising alternative, with ongoing standardization efforts. Recommendations for international regulators include fostering collaboration and information sharing, establishing global standards, supporting research and development in quantum security, harmonizing legal frameworks, promoting cryptographic agility, and raising awareness and education. The financial industry must adopt a proactive and adaptive approach to cybersecurity, investing in research, developing migration plans for quantum-resistant cryptography, and embracing a multi-faceted, collaborative strategy to build a resilient, quantum-safe, and AI-resilient financial ecosystem",

      "abstract": "Scientific computing applications usually need huge amounts of computational power. The cloud provides interesting high-performance computing solutions, with its promise of virtually infinite resources on demand. However, migrating scientific computing problems to clouds and the re-creation of software environment on the vendor-supplied OS and cloud instances is often a laborious task. It is also assumed that the scientist who is performing the experiments has significant knowledge of computer science, cloud computing and the migration procedure, which is often not true. Considering these obstacles, we have designed a tool suite that migrates the complete software environment directly to the cloud. The developed desktop-to-cloud-migration (D2CM) tool supports transformation and migration of virtual machine images, reusable deployment description and life-cycle management for applications to be hosted on Amazon Cloud or compatible infrastructure such as Eucalyptus. The paper also presents an electrochemical case study and computational experiments targeted at designing modern supercapacitors. These experiments have extensively used the tool in drawing domain specific results. Detailed analysis of the case showed that D2CM tool not only simplifies the migration procedure for the scientists, but also helps them in optimizing the calculations and compute clusters, by providing them a new dimension -- cost-to-value of computational experiments.",
