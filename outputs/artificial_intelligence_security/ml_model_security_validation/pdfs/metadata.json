      "abstract": "As AI models scale to billions of parameters and operate with increasing autonomy, ensuring their safe, reliable operation demands engineering-grade security and assurance frameworks. This paper presents an enterprise-level, risk-aware, security-by-design approach for large-scale autonomous AI systems, integrating standardized threat metrics, adversarial hardening techniques, and real-time anomaly detection into every phase of the development lifecycle. We detail a unified pipeline - from design-time risk assessments and secure training protocols to continuous monitoring and automated audit logging - that delivers provable guarantees of model behavior under adversarial and operational stress. Case studies in national security, open-source model governance, and industrial automation demonstrate measurable reductions in vulnerability and compliance overhead. Finally, we advocate cross-sector collaboration - uniting engineering teams, standards bodies, and regulatory agencies - to institutionalize these technical safeguards within a resilient, end-to-end assurance ecosystem for the next generation of AI.",

      "abstract": "Security vulnerabilities play a vital role in network security system. Fuzzing technology is widely used as a vulnerability discovery technology to reduce damage in advance. However, traditional fuzzing techniques have many challenges, such as how to mutate input seed files, how to increase code coverage, and how to effectively bypass verification. Machine learning technology has been introduced as a new method into fuzzing test to alleviate these challenges. This paper reviews the research progress of using machine learning technology for fuzzing test in recent years, analyzes how machine learning improve the fuzz process and results, and sheds light on future work in fuzzing. Firstly, this paper discusses the reasons why machine learning techniques can be used for fuzzing scenarios and identifies six different stages in which machine learning have been used. Then this paper systematically study the machine learning based fuzzing models from selection of machine learning algorithm, pre-processing methods, datasets, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameters setting. Next, this paper assesses the performance of the machine learning models based on the frequently used evaluation metrics. The results of the evaluation prove that machine learning technology has an acceptable capability of categorize predictive for fuzzing. Finally, the comparison on capability of discovering vulnerabilities between traditional fuzzing tools and machine learning based fuzzing tools is analyzed. The results depict that the introduction of machine learning technology can improve the performance of fuzzing. However, there are still some limitations, such as unbalanced training samples and difficult to extract the characteristics related to vulnerabilities.",

      "authors": [
        "Aviral Srivastava",
        "Sourav Panda"
      ],
      "abstract": "As generative AI systems, including large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, advance rapidly, their growing adoption has led to new and complex security risks often overlooked in traditional AI risk assessment frameworks. This paper introduces a novel formal framework for categorizing and mitigating these emergent security risks by integrating adaptive, real-time monitoring, and dynamic risk mitigation strategies tailored to generative models' unique vulnerabilities. We identify previously under-explored risks, including latent space exploitation, multi-modal cross-attack vectors, and feedback-loop-induced model degradation. Our framework employs a layered approach, incorporating anomaly detection, continuous red-teaming, and real-time adversarial simulation to mitigate these risks. We focus on formal verification methods to ensure model robustness and scalability in the face of evolving threats. Though theoretical, this work sets the stage for future empirical validation by establishing a detailed methodology and metrics for evaluating the performance of risk mitigation strategies in generative AI systems. This framework addresses existing gaps in AI safety, offering a comprehensive road map for future research and implementation.",
