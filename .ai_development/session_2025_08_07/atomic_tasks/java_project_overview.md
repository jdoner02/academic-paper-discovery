### Design Philosophy
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain objects that understand their own business rules
- **Clean Architecture**: Proper layer separation for educational demonstration
- **SOLID Principles**: Every class demonstrates single responsibility and proper abstractions
- **Template Method Pattern**: Self-assessing standards objects with consistent evaluation framework
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable game implementations that map to educational standards
- **Factory Pattern**: Creation of standards objects from CSV data ingestion

### Technology Stack (All Java Ecosystem)
- **Build Tool**: Maven with educational plugin configuration
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 with comprehensive test coverage demonstration
- **Database**: SQLite with pure Java driver for simplicity
- **Web Server**: Embedded Jetty for local development
- **JSON Processing**: Jackson for standards data serialization
- **Logging**: SLF4J with Logback for educational logging patterns

### Educational Goals
1. **OOP Mastery**: Inheritance, composition, aggregation physically demonstrated in folder structure
2. **Design Patterns**: Template Method, Strategy, Factory, Observer patterns in action
3. **Clean Code**: Every line demonstrates professional coding standards
4. **TDD Workflow**: Test-first development with educational progression
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive JavaDoc and README files explaining architectural decisions

### Assessment Framework
Six-level progression aligned with Bloom's taxonomy:
- **NOVICE**: Can identify and describe basic concepts
- **BASIC**: Can implement simple solutions with guidance
- **DEVELOPING**: Can apply patterns with some independence
- **PROFICIENT**: Can analyze and modify existing solutions
- **ADVANCED**: Can evaluate trade-offs and design new solutions
- **MASTERED**: Can create comprehensive frameworks and teach others

### File Organization Strategy
Each directory physically demonstrates OOP relationships:
- **IS-A relationships**: Inheritance hierarchies in package structure
- **HAS-A relationships**: Composition demonstrated through nested classes
- **USES-A relationships**: Dependencies shown through package imports
- **package-info.java**: Explains architectural concepts at each level

### Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: >95% for domain and application layers
- **Documentation Coverage**: Every public method with comprehensive JavaDoc
- **Code Quality**: Zero warnings with strict PMD/Checkstyle rules
- **Educational Comments**: Pedagogical explanations throughout codebase
- **Industry Standards**: Pacific Northwest tech sector best practices

### Integration Points
- **AP Computer Science Standards**: Programmatically ingested from CSV files
- **CSCD 210/211 Curriculum**: Atomic concepts mapped to learning objectives
- **Game Framework**: Contract interface for educational game development
- **Assessment Engine**: Automated competency validation and progress tracking

This framework serves as a complete educational example while being a functional learning platform for cybersecurity and computer science education through engaging gameplay.
