"""
Simple Knowledge Graph Demonstration - Showcases graph algorithms on task hierarchies.

This demonstrates the practical application of knowledge graph traversal algorithms
on the educational atomic task framework, bridging theory and practice.

Educational Notes:
- Shows real-world application of graph theory concepts
- Demonstrates BFS, DFS, topological sorting, and PageRank on educational tasks
- Illustrates how computer science algorithms solve project management problems
