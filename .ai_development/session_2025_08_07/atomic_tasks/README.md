# Atomic Tasks Framework Documentation

## Overview
This directory contains the comprehensive task decomposition system for the Academic Paper Discovery project. Each task is designed to support educational software engineering simulation with rich metadata for assessment and learning.

## Task Hierarchy
```
Epic (3-6 months) 
└── Feature (2-4 weeks)
    └── User Story (1-3 days)
        └── Task (2-8 hours)
            └── Subtask (15min-2hours)
```

## Educational Framework Integration
- Bloom's Taxonomy mapping for cognitive skill levels
- Industry role-based skill matrices (Pacific Northwest tech sector focus)
- Assessment rubrics from Novice to Mastered levels
- Unit test questions for automated competency validation
- Wiki cross-reference system for "just-in-time" learning

## Agile Simulation Support  
- Realistic story point estimation
- Sprint planning compatible task sizing
- Mentor-mentee interaction patterns
- Daily standup progress tracking
- Retrospective improvement cycles

## Usage
Tasks are designed to be:
1. **Educationally Rich**: Each includes learning objectives and skill requirements
2. **Industry Realistic**: Based on actual software engineering practices
3. **Progressively Complex**: Scaffolded from basic to advanced concepts
4. **Assessment Ready**: Include automated evaluation criteria
5. **Simulation Compatible**: Support agile workflow simulation

## Quality Standards
- Every task includes comprehensive metadata
- Clear acceptance criteria and definition of done
- Estimated effort in both hours and story points
- Dependencies and prerequisite identification
- Role assignments with skill level requirements
