# Comprehensive Repository Cleanup and Pedagogical Enhancement Plan
**Session: August 7, 2025**
**Priority: Complete repository refactoring for pedagogical excellence and professional presentation**

## Executive Summary

This repository has evolved into a sophisticated automated research paper aggregation system but suffers from documentation that doesn't match its actual purpose, incomplete wiki content, and inconsistent pedagogical documentation. The goal is to transform it into a pedagogical masterpiece that clearly communicates its purpose as an automated research monitoring tool while maintaining its technical excellence.

## Critical Problems Identified

### 1. **README Documentation Crisis** ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY
**Problem**: Three conflicting README files with incorrect descriptions
- `README.md` - Describes "Interactive Research Paper Discovery Platform" 
- `README_NEW.md` - Similar but cleaned up version
- `README_STATIC.md` - Describes static GitHub Pages deployment

**Reality**: This is an **automated research paper aggregation and concept extraction system** that:
- Uses YAML configuration files to define search strategies across research domains
- Automatically scrapes ArXiv and other open access sources
- Downloads and organizes papers by domain
- Extracts concepts and builds hierarchical knowledge maps
- Provides CLI and GUI interfaces for research workflow integration

### 2. **Incomplete Wiki Infrastructure** ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY  
**Problem**: Home.md references 30+ wiki pages that don't exist
**Missing Pages**: Domain Layer, Entities, Value Objects, Application Layer, Use Cases, Ports, Infrastructure Layer, Repositories, Concept Extraction Pipeline, Rule-Based Extraction, Statistical Methods, Embedding-Based Clustering, Hierarchical Organization, Concept Hierarchies, Evidence Grounding, Quality Metrics, Interactive D3.js Visualization, Concept Sunburst, Force-Directed Networks, Evidence Panels, User Interface Design, Academic UX Principles, Onboarding System, Accessibility, Educational Documentation, Testing Framework, Paper Collection Pipeline, Concept Storage, Development Resources, API Documentation, Code Examples, Contributing Guidelines

### 3. **GitHub Wiki Integration Missing** ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY

**Requirements**: 
- Enable GitHub Wiki for repository
- Sync content from `/docs/wiki/` to GitHub Wiki
- Ensure cross-references work properly

### 4. **Pedagogical Documentation Gaps** ðŸ”´ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: Inconsistent educational documentation throughout codebase
**Requirements**:
- Every file needs comprehensive pedagogical header comments
- Cross-domain analogies for STEM fields (physics, math, engineering, biology, chemistry)
- Just-in-time learning explanations
- Links to relevant wiki pages for deeper dives

### 5. **Code Implementation Gaps** ðŸ”´ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Problem**: Multiple TODO/placeholder implementations found
**Specific Issues**:
- `src/application/use_cases/ExtractConceptsUseCase.ts` - Missing core concept extraction logic
- `src/domain/entities/paper_concepts.py` - Placeholder similarity detection
- `src/domain/services/multi_strategy_concept_extractor.py` - Placeholder grouping logic
- `gui/app.py` - Placeholder statistics functions

### 6. **Inconsistent File Organization** ðŸŸ¡ LOW PRIORITY
**Problem**: Mixed naming conventions and unclear file purposes
**Issues**:
- Mixed underscore/hyphen naming
- Large `outputs/` directory should be in `.gitignore`
- Unclear separation between Python and TypeScript implementations
