# Multi-Source Paper Aggregation Development Log
## Session: August 5, 2025

### Objective
Implement multi-source paper aggregation system supporting ArXiv, PubMed, Google Scholar, and potentially IEEE Xplore. The system should provide strategy-based output organization, idempotent downloads, and comprehensive metadata preservation.

### Development Methodology
Following TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle with atomic commits and comprehensive educational documentation.

### Current Status
- ✅ **Foundation Validation**: All 32 test files operational, core system stable
- ✅ **Configuration Fixes**: Standardized all YAML configs to use strategies:{} format  
- ✅ **TDD Setup**: Development logs created, methodology established
- ⏳ **Phase 1**: Multi-source repository abstractions and contracts

### Implementation Plan (8 Phases)

#### Phase 1: Foundation (3-4 commits)
1. **Test + Implement**: Multi-source repository abstractions and contracts
2. **Test + Implement**: Enhanced metadata system with source tracking
3. **Test + Implement**: Paper fingerprinting and duplicate detection
4. **Test + Implement**: Strategy-based output organization

#### Phase 2: Source Implementations (2-3 commits per source)
1. **Test + Implement**: PubMed repository with full API integration
2. **Test + Implement**: Google Scholar repository (with rate limiting)
3. **Test + Implement**: IEEE Xplore repository (if API access available)

#### Phase 3: Integration (2-3 commits)
1. **Test + Implement**: Multi-source aggregation use case
2. **Test + Implement**: Enhanced download service with idempotency
3. **Test + Implement**: CLI integration with new multi-source capabilities

### Validation Criteria for Each Commit
- All tests pass (unit, integration, contract, e2e)
- >90% test coverage maintained
- Educational documentation complete
- Performance benchmarks met
- Clean Architecture principles preserved

### Next Steps
Begin Phase 1 implementation with comprehensive test cases that define desired behavior across multiple paper sources while maintaining strategy-based output organization and idempotent download functionality.

### Architectural Decisions
- **Repository Pattern**: Each source implements PaperSourcePort interface
- **Adapter Pattern**: Source adapters handle API specifics
- **Strategy Pattern**: Output organization follows configuration strategies
- **Value Object Pattern**: Paper fingerprinting for duplicate detection
- **Service Pattern**: Metadata enrichment and duplicate detection services

### Key Features to Implement
- Multi-source paper repository abstraction
- Source-specific metadata preservation with provenance tracking
- Idempotent download system with duplicate detection
- Strategy-based folder organization (outputs/[config]/[strategy]/)
- Comprehensive educational documentation throughout
