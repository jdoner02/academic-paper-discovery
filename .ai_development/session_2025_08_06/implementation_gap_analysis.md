# Implementation Gap Analysis: Concept Extraction System
**Date**: August 6, 2025  
**Session**: .ai_development/session_2025_08_06  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of current implementation vs analysis requirements  

## Executive Summary

**Current State**: The research paper aggregator has a sophisticated foundation with Clean Architecture, multi-strategy concept extraction, and domain-driven design. The implementation is much more advanced than initially expected.

**Gap Analysis Result**: ~70% of core functionality exists. Primary gaps are in visualization layer, GUI implementation, and some advanced extraction strategies.

**Next Phase Priority**: Interactive D3.js visualization with zoomable concept maps and evidence panels.
