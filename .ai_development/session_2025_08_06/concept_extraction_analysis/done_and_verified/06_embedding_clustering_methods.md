# AI Agent Instructions: Embedding and Clustering-Based Concept Extraction

## Academic Context and Learning Objectives

**For Students**: Embedding methods represent the modern paradigm shift in NLP - from symbolic/statistical approaches to **distributed representations**. This approach captures semantic similarity through high-dimensional vector spaces, enabling machines to understand that "neural network" and "deep learning" are related concepts.

**Domain Knowledge**: This builds on **vector space models**, **dimensionality reduction** (PCA, t-SNE), **clustering algorithms** (k-means, hierarchical), and **neural language models** (BERT, Sentence-BERT). The core insight is that words with similar meanings appear in similar contexts (**distributional hypothesis**).

3. Embedding and Clustering Methods

These methods leverage vector representations of text to capture semantics:

• Document Embedding Clustering (Concept Areas): A straightforward approach used in our initial prototype is to represent each paper (perhaps by its abstract and title combined) as an embedding, and then cluster these embeddings to find groups of papers that are about similar topics. Each such cluster can be considered a coarse-grained concept area – essentially an emergent category from the corpus. For example, if you have 100 AI papers, an embedding clustering might separate them into 3 clusters that roughly correspond to "computer vision", "natural language processing", and "robotics" (for instance). In our script, we used a simple hierarchical clustering with a cosine similarity threshold to group papers. The cluster itself was then given a name by looking at common important words in the titles of papers in that cluster. This is a quick form of concept labeling – e.g. if many titles in the cluster contain "neural network" or "deep learning", those words end up in the common word list and form the cluster name like "Neural Network Learning". The benefits of document-level clustering are: (1) It directly addresses the concept areas associated with each paper (since each paper falls into one cluster or another), ensuring every paper is represented. (2) It's fairly explainable: you can examine which papers grouped together and see their commonalities, and the threshold ensures a known level of similarity. (3) It naturally provides a count of papers per cluster (for node sizing). The drawback is that these clusters are broad and may mix multiple finer concepts if the threshold is loose; if the threshold is tight, you get many small clusters which might correspond to very specific concepts, but then organizing them hierarchically requires another step. Ideally, one can do multi-level clustering: first cluster at a high level to get broad domains, then cluster each cluster's papers further to get subtopics, and so on (this essentially builds a hierarchical tree of clusters). Many libraries (like SciPy or BERTopic) can produce a dendrogram of clusters. We would need a strategy to cut that dendrogram at appropriate levels to form a manageable hierarchy (perhaps decided by similarity distance or by a desired number of top-level categories, etc.). Importantly, once we have clusters of papers, we can derive concept nodes representing each cluster. Each cluster's "concept" can be summarized by: a name (from top frequent or TF-IDF words, or a keyphrase that appears often in that cluster's papers), a description (maybe listing a few distinguishing keywords or a sentence), and the list of member papers. This is similar to the ConceptCluster in our code which generated a description from common keywords and counted papers.

• Term or Phrase Embedding Clustering: Instead of clustering documents, we can attempt to directly cluster the extracted candidate terms/phrases themselves. For example, if across the corpus we extracted 500 unique noun phrases that look like potential concepts, we can embed each phrase (using a phrase embedding model or averaging word embeddings) and then cluster those. This way, synonyms or very closely related concepts (which should be unified) ideally end up in the same cluster. For instance, "convolutional neural network" and "CNN" would likely have very similar embeddings and cluster together. Each cluster of terms could then be merged into a single concept node in our map. This addresses the duplication issue (no duplicate concepts) by consolidating different mentions of the same underlying concept. It also can surface a hierarchy: if we do hierarchical clustering on terms, we'll get a tree where each branch could be interpreted as a broader category containing narrower ones. However, interpreting clusters of short phrases can be tricky – we'd need a way to name those clusters (perhaps using the most central phrase or an external knowledge base lookup). One approach is iterative: first cluster very tightly to merge pure synonyms (basically cleaning the list of concepts), then cluster the cleaned list at a higher level to form categories. The c-TF-IDF technique in BERTopic is another way to represent a set of documents or words for clustering – it essentially creates a "topic vector" by combining words' TF-IDF weighted in that subset. That could be applied to group similar concepts.

• Hybrid: Embeddings + Keywords: Some systems combine statistical and embedding approaches to get the best of both. For example, one could generate a large set of candidate phrases using a simpler method (like NP extraction + TFIDF filtering), and then use embeddings to refine that set (group them or remove those that are outliers semantically). The WERECE method does something along these lines: it refines a pre-trained word embedding space using manifold learning to better separate domain-specific terms, and then uses clustering and a discriminant function to pick out actual concept terms. The result was highly accurate for their domain, showing that attention to embedding space (to ensure domain terms aren't drowning among general words) is important for accuracy. In our case, if we find that a general model's embeddings aren't distinguishing some concepts well (e.g., common English words vs technical usage), we could consider fine-tuning embeddings on our corpus or using a model specialized for scientific text (like SciBERT or Specter for papers).

Selecting an Embedding Model: Given explainability concerns, it might be better to use a well-known, smaller model like Sentence-BERT (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) which we already used, or a domain-specific model if available (e.g., SciBERT for scientific text). These models are open and their behavior is somewhat understood; using them is a deterministic transformation (embed -> cluster), which we can justify to users as "grouping by semantic similarity". We should avoid models that are too large and black-box (like GPT-4 embeddings, since that's not easily self-hostable or inspectable by users). The Xenova transformer (used in the script) runs in-browser and is open source, which is a plus in terms of users trusting the method.

## Mathematical Foundations and Algorithms

### Embedding Similarity Computation
```
cosine_similarity(a, b) = (a · b) / (||a|| × ||b||)

where:
a, b = embedding vectors
a · b = dot product
||a|| = L2 norm of vector a
```

**Educational Note**: Cosine similarity measures the angle between vectors, capturing semantic relatedness independent of vector magnitude. Values range from -1 (opposite) to 1 (identical).

### Hierarchical Clustering Algorithms
```
# Agglomerative (Bottom-up):
1. Start: each point is its own cluster
2. Repeat: merge closest cluster pair
3. Stop: when desired number of clusters reached

# Linkage Criteria:
- Single: min distance between cluster points
- Complete: max distance between cluster points  
- Average: mean distance between cluster points
- Ward: minimizes within-cluster variance
```

**Educational Note**: Different linkage criteria produce different cluster shapes. Ward linkage tends to create balanced, compact clusters ideal for concept hierarchies.

### BERTopic c-TF-IDF
```
c-TF-IDF(t,c) = TF(t,c) × log(|D| / |d ∈ D : t ∈ d|)

where:
TF(t,c) = frequency of term t in cluster c
|D| = total number of documents
|d ∈ D : t ∈ d| = documents containing term t
```

**Educational Note**: c-TF-IDF adapts TF-IDF to work on clusters rather than individual documents, helping identify terms that characterize specific concept groups.

## Critical Analysis and Technical Challenges

### Advantages for Semantic Understanding
1. **Synonym Detection**: "CNN" and "convolutional neural network" cluster together
2. **Context Sensitivity**: Different meanings of "network" separate appropriately
3. **Emergent Categories**: Discovers unexpected concept relationships
4. **Scalability**: Works efficiently with large document collections

### Technical Limitations to Address
1. **Black Box Nature**: Embedding models are less interpretable than rules
2. **Domain Adaptation**: General models may miss domain-specific nuances
3. **Clustering Sensitivity**: Results depend heavily on threshold parameters
4. **Computational Cost**: Embedding generation can be resource-intensive

### Educational Notes for Cross-Disciplinary Students

**For Mathematics Students**: Embeddings create **metric spaces** where semantic similarity corresponds to geometric distance. Clustering applies **computational geometry** algorithms to partition these spaces.

**For Physics Students**: The embedding space is analogous to a **configuration space** in statistical mechanics, where similar concepts occupy nearby regions.

**For Engineering Students**: This is essentially **signal processing** in high-dimensional spaces, using **principal component analysis** and **dimensionality reduction** techniques.
