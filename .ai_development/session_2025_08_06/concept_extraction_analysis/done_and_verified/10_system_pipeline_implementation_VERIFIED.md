## Original Content

> Based on the above exploration, here is a detailed pipeline for implementing the concept extraction and mapping system. Each step includes technical details and justifications:

> **Step 1: Paper Text Extraction and Preparation** - Input is a repository of PDF files (and possibly metadata like titles, authors if available). We will use a PDF parsing library (e.g., PyMuPDF or PDF.js or a CLI like pdftotext) to extract textual content from each PDF. Focus on sections with informative content (title, abstract, introduction, conclusion) â€“ though concepts could appear anywhere, the abstract/introduction often contains high-level topics and definitions.

> **Step 2: Candidate Concept Extraction per Paper** - For each paper's text, extract a set of candidate concept terms: Use noun phrase extraction to get multi-word candidates. SpaCy can give noun chunks; we filter them (drop those shorter than say 2 characters, drop pure stopword chunks, etc.). Augment with any author keywords or section titles.

> **Step 3: Concept Candidate Consolidation (Global)** - Take the pool of candidate concepts from all papers and merge duplicates and obvious variants: Normalize strings (lowercase, maybe singularize plurals if that makes sense, strip hyphens etc.). Use embedding similarity among the candidate terms to catch closely related phrases.

> **Step 4: Build Initial Concept Hierarchy (Clustering)** - With the unique concept list, perform hierarchical clustering to organize them. Two possible tracks: A: If we want to leverage document clustering, first cluster documents (papers) by embedding into broad domains. B: Directly cluster concept embeddings hierarchically.

## Academic Context and System Architecture Analysis

### Pipeline Architecture Pattern
This subsection describes a **Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) pipeline** common in data engineering, adapted for academic knowledge processing. The four-step pipeline follows **separation of concerns** and **single responsibility** principles:

1. **Extraction Layer** - PDF text extraction with metadata preservation
2. **Transformation Layer** - Concept extraction and normalization 
3. **Integration Layer** - Deduplication and semantic consolidation
4. **Organization Layer** - Hierarchical clustering and structure building

### Educational Note: Natural Language Processing Pipeline
For students from non-CS backgrounds, **NLP pipelines** are sequential processing stages that transform raw text into structured knowledge. Think of it like a **signal processing chain** in electrical engineering, where each stage applies specific filters and transformations to improve signal quality.

### System Design Patterns Identification

#### 1. Pipeline Pattern (Chain of Responsibility)
Each processing step has a clear input/output interface, enabling:
- **Modularity** - Each step can be developed and tested independently
- **Reusability** - Steps can be reordered or replaced without affecting others
- **Debugging** - Issues can be isolated to specific pipeline stages
- **Scalability** - Steps can be parallelized or distributed

#### 2. Strategy Pattern for Multi-Algorithm Support
The document mentions multiple approaches (document clustering vs. concept clustering), indicating need for **pluggable algorithms**:
```python
class ConceptExtractionStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def extract_concepts(self, text: str) -> List[CandidateConcept]:
        pass

class NounPhraseExtractionStrategy(ConceptExtractionStrategy):
    # SpaCy-based noun phrase extraction
    
class EmbeddingBasedExtractionStrategy(ConceptExtractionStrategy):
    # Transformer-based semantic extraction
```

#### 3. Factory Pattern for Algorithm Selection
Different domains may require different extraction strategies:
```python
class ConceptExtractorFactory:
    @staticmethod
    def create_extractor(domain: str, config: ExtractionConfig) -> ConceptExtractor:
        # Return appropriate extractor based on domain and configuration
```

## Codebase Implementation Mapping

### Existing Infrastructure Assessment
Based on current `src/` structure, we can map pipeline steps to Clean Architecture layers:

**Domain Layer (`src/domain/`)**:
- `entities/research_paper.py` - Paper representation with text content
- `entities/concept.py` - Enhanced for hierarchical relationships (from Step 1 analysis)
- `services/concept_extraction_service.py` - Domain service coordinating extraction

**Application Layer (`src/application/`)**:
- `use_cases/extract_hierarchical_concepts_use_case.py` - Main pipeline orchestration
- `use_cases/prepare_visualization_data_use_case.py` - GUI data preparation
- `ports/pdf_extraction_port.py` - Text extraction interface
- `ports/concept_clustering_port.py` - Hierarchical clustering interface

**Infrastructure Layer (`src/infrastructure/`)**:
- `services/spacy_text_processor.py` - NLP processing implementation
- `services/sentence_transformer_embedding_service.py` - Semantic similarity
- `repositories/concept_hierarchy_repository.py` - Persistence for concept trees
- `pdf_extractor.py` - Already exists, may need enhancement

### Missing Components for Full Pipeline

#### Step 1: Enhanced PDF Processing
```python
# src/infrastructure/services/enhanced_pdf_extractor.py
class EnhancedPDFTextExtractor:
    """

    """
    
    def extract_with_metadata(self, pdf_path: Path) -> ExtractedPaperContent:
        # Implementation with page-aware extraction
        
    def identify_paper_sections(self, text: str) -> Dict[str, str]:
