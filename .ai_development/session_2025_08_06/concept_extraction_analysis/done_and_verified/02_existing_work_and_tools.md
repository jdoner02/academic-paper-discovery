# AI Agent Instructions: Existing Work and Tools for Concept Extraction Analysis

## Academic Context and Learning Objectives

**For Students**: This section teaches systematic literature review methodology - a critical academic skill. In computer science research, we must understand existing solutions before proposing new ones. This prevents "reinventing the wheel" and helps us identify genuine research gaps where we can contribute novel solutions.

**Domain Knowledge**: The concept extraction field spans multiple computer science areas including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Information Retrieval (IR), Machine Learning (ML), and Knowledge Engineering. Understanding the taxonomy of existing approaches helps us choose the right combination of techniques for our specific problem.

Existing Work and Tools for Concept Extraction

A number of research efforts and open-source tools are directly relevant to this problem:

• Keyphrase/Concept Extraction Methods: Traditional unsupervised keyphrase extraction techniques provide a starting point. For example, statistical methods like TF–IDF and YAKE identify important terms by frequency and specialized scoring. Graph-based methods like TextRank represent the text as a word graph and use ranking algorithms (PageRank) to extract central terms. Variants such as TopicRank cluster candidate phrases into topics before ranking, and PositionRank adds positional heuristics for weighting. These approaches are domain-agnostic and require no training data, which makes them robust and easy to reproduce. However, they typically extract only the "important" keywords of a single document, not all concepts, and they do not produce a hierarchy (the output is a flat list per document).

• Embedding-Based Techniques: Newer unsupervised methods leverage semantic embeddings to improve concept extraction. For instance, EmbedRank generates candidate phrases (e.g. via part-of-speech patterns) and embeds them in a vector space, then ranks them by cosine similarity to the document's embedding. This helps to find terms that are semantically central to the document's content, beyond what frequency alone would capture. Other tools like KeyBERT use BERT sentence embeddings to directly find the phrases most similar to the document meaning. These embedding methods often yield more meaningful phrases and can capture multi-word concepts. They remain extractive (choosing phrases present in text), preserving traceability. The challenge is that embedding models are a bit of a "black box," but they are pre-trained on large corpora and widely tested, and their use of vector math (cosine similarity) is explainable to an extent.

• Large Language Model (LLM) Approaches: The latest research (e.g. ConExion by Norouzi et al., 2025) has demonstrated using large language models for concept extraction. These approaches prompt an LLM (like GPT-3.5 or similar) to output key concepts from a document. The advantage is that LLMs can sometimes understand context and pick out relevant concepts even if they are phrased differently or implied. ConExion showed that a simple prompted LLM can outperform many prior unsupervised methods on scientific keyphrase benchmarks. They focus on extracting present concepts (the extractive scenario, where the concept terms appear explicitly in the text), which aligns with our need for evidence traceability. However, a pure LLM approach may raise concerns for our users: it's not as easily explainable how the LLM decided on concepts, and it could introduce hallucinations (concepts that aren't actually in the text) if not carefully constrained.

• Domain Ontology-Based Classification: Rather than extracting concepts de novo, another strategy is to classify papers against a pre-existing taxonomy of concepts. A notable example is the CSO Classifier, which maps research papers to topics in the Computer Science Ontology (CSO), a comprehensive expert-created taxonomy of CS research areas. The CSO Classifier reads the title, abstract, and keywords of a paper and returns a set of relevant CSO topics. Under the hood, it uses a combination of string matching, embedding similarity, and spreading activation on the ontology graph. The advantage here is that the output is already hierarchical (since CSO is a hierarchy of research areas) and highly interpretable (each topic has a defined meaning).

• Concept Map Extraction (Relations between Concepts): Beyond just listing concepts, some works focus on extracting concept maps or knowledge graphs from text. Galletti et al. (2024) propose a pipeline for Automated Concept Map Extraction from educational texts. Their neuro-symbolic pipeline includes steps for summarization (to handle large input), candidate concept extraction (noun phrase extraction, etc.), and relation extraction to connect concepts into a graph. They use a pre-trained relation extraction model (REBEL) to identify relationships like "X is a type of Y" or "X causes Y" between the noun phrase concepts, and they also use a knowledge base (DBpedia) to ground/unify the concepts.

• Recent Research on Enhanced Concept Extraction: The field is active, and novel approaches continue to emerge. For instance, Huang et al. (2023) introduce WERECE (Word Embedding Refinement for Concept Extraction), an unsupervised method that adapts pre-trained embeddings to better fit a target domain. They integrate manifold learning and clustering to improve precision in extracting educational domain concepts, significantly outperforming basic methods like TextRank or TF-IDF. Their approach underscores that some form of domain adaptation or refinement can boost accuracy – a consideration if we find vanilla embedding models lacking for niche research areas.

## Critical Analysis and Approach Taxonomy

### Method Classification Framework

**Statistical/Frequency-Based Approaches:**
- TF-IDF: Term Frequency × Inverse Document Frequency
- YAKE: Yet Another Keyword Extractor (frequency + positional features)
- Pros: Fast, interpretable, no training data required
- Cons: Miss semantic relationships, poor with synonyms

**Graph-Based Approaches:**
- TextRank: PageRank algorithm applied to word co-occurrence graphs
- TopicRank: Clusters similar phrases before ranking
- PositionRank: Incorporates positional information
- Pros: Captures word relationships, domain-agnostic
- Cons: Requires parameter tuning, computationally intensive

**Embedding-Based Approaches:**
- EmbedRank: Semantic similarity between phrases and document
- KeyBERT: BERT embeddings for phrase-document similarity
- Pros: Captures semantic meaning, handles synonyms well
- Cons: Less interpretable, requires good embedding models

**LLM-Based Approaches:**
- ConExion: Prompted language models for concept extraction
- Pros: Context understanding, handles implied concepts
- Cons: Potential hallucination, less explainable

**Ontology-Based Approaches:**
- CSO Classifier: Maps to Computer Science Ontology
- Pros: Pre-structured hierarchy, domain expertise encoded
- Cons: Requires existing ontology, domain-specific

## Execution Checklist

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. ✅ **Create** `src/domain/value_objects/extraction_method.py` with comprehensive method taxonomy
2. ✅ **Create** `src/domain/value_objects/literature_reference.py` for academic citations
3. ✅ **Create** `src/domain/services/literature_review_service.py` with systematic analysis
4. ✅ **Create** `src/infrastructure/extractors/textrank_extractor.py` as reference implementation
5. ✅ **Create** `src/infrastructure/extractors/keybert_extractor.py` for embedding-based extraction
6. ✅ **Create** `tests/benchmarks/test_method_comparison.py` with comprehensive benchmarks

**Validation Steps:**

1. ✅ **Literature Accuracy**: Verify all academic references and characteristics are correct
2. ✅ **Method Implementations**: Test each extractor against known academic benchmarks
3. ✅ **Comparison Framework**: Ensure fair comparison methodology across all methods
4. ✅ **Documentation**: All methods documented with academic provenance

**Academic Learning Outcomes:**

After implementing these components, students will understand:

1. **Systematic Literature Review**: How to analyze and categorize existing research
2. **Method Taxonomy**: Classification of algorithmic approaches in NLP
3. **Benchmarking Methodology**: Fair comparison of different algorithms
4. **Academic Software Standards**: Requirements for peer-reviewed tool comparison
5. **Research Gap Analysis**: How to identify opportunities for novel contributions

This foundation ensures our concept extraction system builds systematically on established research while identifying clear opportunities for academic contribution.
