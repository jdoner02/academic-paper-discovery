# AI Agent Instructions: Constructing Hierarchical Concept Structures

## Academic Context and Learning Objectives

**For Students**: Hierarchical organization is fundamental to human knowledge representation. From biological taxonomies to library classification systems, humans naturally organize concepts in tree structures. This module tackles the computational challenge of automatically discovering these hierarchical relationships from text.

**Domain Knowledge**: This draws from **graph theory** (tree structures, dendrograms), **clustering algorithms** (agglomerative vs divisive), **ontology engineering** (is-a relationships), and **taxonomy induction** (automated hierarchy construction). The goal is computational **knowledge organization**.

Constructing a Hierarchical Concept Structure

Once we have a set of concepts (likely a large set, possibly hundreds given "hundreds of PDFs"), the next challenge is to arrange them into a meaningful hierarchy or graph. The goal is to reflect relationships like broader vs narrower concepts, which will form the parent-child links in our concept map and enable the zoomable visualization. We discuss several strategies to achieve this structure:

Hierarchical Clustering and Topic Hierarchies

One natural approach is to apply hierarchical clustering to group concepts (or their associated documents) at multiple levels of granularity. This can be done in two main ways:

• Top-Down (Divisive) Clustering: Start with all documents or concepts in one cluster (representing the whole domain), then recursively split clusters. For example, perform a clustering to break the corpus into, say, k top-level clusters (with k chosen based on a target granularity or via a statistical cutoff), then take each cluster and cluster it further into subclusters, and so on. This could use the same algorithm at each level (e.g., k-means or agglomerative) but constrained within a cluster's members. The advantages of top-down: it ensures a clean tree (no overlaps) and one can control how deep to go by setting stopping criteria (e.g., stop splitting when a cluster has fewer than N items or the items are too similar to each other beyond a threshold). It can also be guided by domain knowledge (e.g., specify the top-level division if known, such as "AI vs Systems papers" if it's a mixed collection). Disadvantages: early mistakes (a wrong split at a high level) propagate downward. Also, divisive methods are less common in readily available libraries (though one can simulate by repeated clustering).

• Bottom-Up (Agglomerative) Clustering: This is more common – each document or concept starts as its own cluster, then clusters are merged step by step based on similarity until everything is in one cluster. This produces a full binary tree (dendrogram). We can then cut this tree at different levels to form a hierarchy. For instance, cut at a distance threshold to get top-level groups; within each group's subtree, cut at a lower threshold for subgroups, etc. Tools like SciPy's hierarchy.linkage (Ward method or others) can do this easily. Advantage: we don't need to decide k at each level, we just decide distance thresholds (or number of levels). We get a nested structure naturally. Challenge: deciding where to cut is somewhat arbitrary – we might need to experiment or even allow the user to zoom continuously along the dendrogram. For visualization, we probably want a fixed number of discrete levels though (e.g., level 1 broad areas, level 2 sub-areas, level 3 specific topics, level 4 atomic concepts). We can achieve that by analyzing the cluster distances: often there are "gaps" in distance where merging very dissimilar clusters happens – those gaps can indicate natural cut points.

Regardless of top-down or bottom-up, using semantic similarity (embedding cosine or some distance) as the metric is key so that clusters reflect actual topical similarity. BERTopic's approach, for example, effectively performs hierarchical clustering on topic vectors to suggest a topic merge tree. We can analogously cluster concept phrase embeddings.

One issue is labeling intermediate clusters (to name the parent nodes). Some approaches:
• Use the same method as before: find the most representative terms of that cluster. If our items being clustered are documents, we could recompute a mini topic model for that cluster or take the top TF-IDF terms in that subset. If clustering terms, perhaps pick a term that is closest to the centroid as the label, or merge the words (though that might produce a weird concatenation).
• Simpler, we could present the cluster label as a list of top few terms rather than a single term. E.g., a node could be titled "{network, learning, algorithm}" or a short phrase like "network & learning algorithms" derived from those words. Our earlier script concatenated up to 3 frequent distinctive words capitalized as a name – not always grammatical, but it gives a hint. We could improve that with a template: e.g., "Algorithms for Neural Network Learning" if we detect one word is an umbrella (just an idea).

Hierarchical topic modeling (like hLDA or HLTA) is an alternative that directly yields a hierarchy of word clusters. These models ensure each child topic shares terms with the parent topic (creating a coherent tree). Using something like hLDA could be powerful: it might naturally output something like level 1: {Computer Vision, Machine Learning, …}, level 2 under ML: {Neural Networks, Probabilistic Models, …}, etc. However, hLDA is non-trivial to implement and tune, and not widely available in stable libraries compared to simpler clustering. It also might produce topics that aren't explicitly present phrases. So practically, the clustering approach might suffice.

Taxonomy Induction and Parent-Child Relations

Beyond pure clustering, we can attempt to determine explicit parent-child links between concepts by analyzing their usage in text and their semantic inclusion:

• Inclusion Relations: If concept A appears very frequently whenever concept B appears (and maybe in text we see phrases like "A-based B" or "B using A"), it might suggest A is a sub-concept or a method under the topic B. For example, "neural network" appears in many "deep learning" papers, but "deep learning" might not be mentioned in some specific "neural network" papers that just assume it. We could measure co-occurrence statistics or conditional probabilities between concept terms across papers. A directed link A -> B (A is parent of B) might be hypothesized if: A appears in many papers without B, but whenever B appears, A often also appears or is implied. This is akin to subset frequency: concept B's documents are largely a subset of concept A's documents. One has to be careful: sometimes two concepts frequently co-occur because they are related siblings rather than parent-child. True hierarchical relations often involve hypernymy (is-a) which usually also manifests in definition sentences (which is where Hearst patterns help, as mentioned). If our corpus or their references contain glossary-like definitions, we might catch some ("X is a Y").

• Manual Curation Option: Since the target users are academics who might inspect the code, one approach is to allow some manual adjustments to the hierarchy. For example, the system could propose a hierarchy but allow a user to reorder or relabel nodes if they see fit, before finalizing the visualization. This would improve acceptance since they can inject their domain knowledge. However, the goal is minimal effort on their part, so ideally the automatic result is good enough. We should design for interpretability such that if they do check, they find the hierarchy logical.

## Mathematical Foundations and Algorithms

### Agglomerative Clustering Algorithm
```
Input: Set of concepts C = {c1, c2, ..., cn}
Output: Hierarchical tree T

1. Initialize: Each concept as singleton cluster
2. Repeat until one cluster remains:
   a. Find closest cluster pair (Ci, Cj)
   b. Merge Ci and Cj into new cluster Ck
   c. Update distance matrix
3. Return dendrogram T
```

### Linkage Criteria for Concept Clustering
```
# Single Linkage (minimum distance)
d(Ci, Cj) = min{d(a,b) : a ∈ Ci, b ∈ Cj}

# Complete Linkage (maximum distance)  
d(Ci, Cj) = max{d(a,b) : a ∈ Ci, b ∈ Cj}

# Average Linkage (mean distance)
d(Ci, Cj) = (1/(|Ci|×|Cj|)) × Σ d(a,b)

# Ward Linkage (minimize within-cluster variance)
d(Ci, Cj) = √((|Ci|×|Cj|)/(|Ci|+|Cj|)) × ||μi - μj||²
```

**Educational Note**: Ward linkage tends to create balanced, compact clusters ideal for concept hierarchies. It minimizes the increase in within-cluster sum of squares when merging.

### Dendrogram Cutting Strategies
```
# Distance-based cutting
cut_height = α × max_distance
where α ∈ [0,1] controls granularity

# Gap statistic for optimal cuts
gap(k) = log(W₀ₖ) - log(Wₖ)
where W₀ₖ = expected within-cluster dispersion
      Wₖ = observed within-cluster dispersion
```

**Educational Note**: The gap statistic compares observed clustering structure with a null model, helping identify natural hierarchy levels.

## Critical Analysis and Technical Challenges

### Advantages of Hierarchical Organization
1. **Cognitive Alignment**: Matches human conceptual organization patterns
2. **Scalable Navigation**: Enables zoom-in/zoom-out interaction paradigms
3. **Multi-Level Insights**: Reveals both broad themes and specific concepts
4. **Visualization-Friendly**: Natural fit for interactive D3.js visualizations

### Technical Challenges to Address
1. **Optimal Granularity**: Determining appropriate number of hierarchy levels
2. **Cluster Labeling**: Automatically generating meaningful names for intermediate nodes
3. **Hierarchy Validation**: Ensuring parent-child relationships make semantic sense
4. **Computational Complexity**: O(n³) for agglomerative clustering with large concept sets

### Educational Notes for Cross-Disciplinary Students

**For Mathematics Students**: Hierarchical clustering applies **metric space theory** and **graph algorithms**. The dendrogram is a **binary tree** with specific geometric properties.

**For Physics Students**: This is analogous to **phase transitions** in statistical mechanics - concepts merge at different "temperature" (similarity) thresholds.

**For Engineering Students**: Think of this as **system decomposition** - breaking complex domains into manageable subsystems with clear interfaces.
