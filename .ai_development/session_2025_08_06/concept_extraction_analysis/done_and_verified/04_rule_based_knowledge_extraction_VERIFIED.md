        return self._basic_noun_phrase_extraction(text)
    
    doc = self.nlp(text)
    noun_phrases = []
    
    for chunk in doc.noun_chunks:
        # Filter out single pronouns and very short phrases
        if len(chunk.text.split()) >= 2 and chunk.root.pos_ != "PRON":
            # Implementation includes sophisticated filtering
```

def extract_hearst_patterns(self, text: str) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    """Extract hierarchical relationships using Hearst patterns."""
    patterns = [
        r"(.+) such as (.+)",
        r"(.+) including (.+)", 
        r"(.+) especially (.+)",
        r"(.+) is a (.+)",

```python
# ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION - Ontology Matching
def match_domain_ontology(self, text: str, ontology: Dict[str, List[str]]) -> List[Tuple[str, float]]:
    """Match text against domain ontology terms."""
    # Sophisticated implementation with contextual scoring
    
def _get_default_ontology(self) -> Dict[str, List[str]]:
    """Get default domain ontology for medical AI research."""
    # Comprehensive ontology with medical, AI, and research terms
```
