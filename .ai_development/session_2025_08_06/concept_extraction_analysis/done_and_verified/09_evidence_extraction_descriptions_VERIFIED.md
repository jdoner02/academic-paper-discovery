# Subsection 9: Evidence Extraction and Concept Descriptions
**Lines 179-198 of concept_extraction_and_mapping.md**

## Original Content

> For every concept in the map (from top-level down to atomic concepts), we want to attach human-readable explanations. There are two main forms of explanation we will provide:

> 1. **Evidence Sentences/Paragraphs**: These are direct quotes from the papers that mention the concept. Since we ensure concepts are extractive (present in text), finding evidence is usually as simple as searching for the concept phrase in the corpus. We can use the context around the first occurrence or the most illustrative occurrence.

> 2. **Concept Descriptions**: Beyond raw quotes, it's useful to have a concise description for each concept node. This could be a short summary (one or two sentences) of what that concept means in the context of this corpus.

> **Linking to PDFs**: Since the user has a repository of PDFs, we can host them or reference them by filename. A concept's evidence sentence could have a link like "Paper XYZ (2021), p.3" which opens the PDF at page 3.

## Academic Context and Critical Analysis

### Evidence-Based Knowledge Grounding
This subsection addresses the fundamental challenge of **knowledge validation** in academic research. Unlike commercial AI systems that may "hallucinate" information, academic tools must provide **verifiable evidence** for every claim. This reflects core principles of the scientific method:

1. **Falsifiability** - Every concept can be verified against source material
2. **Reproducibility** - Evidence can be independently examined
3. **Transparency** - The reasoning chain is fully visible
4. **Traceability** - Each concept links back to its origin

### Educational Note: Information Retrieval and Evidence
For students from non-CS backgrounds, **evidence extraction** is similar to **citation practice** in academic writing. Just as you must cite sources for claims in papers, this system automatically creates citations for every extracted concept.

### Human-Computer Interaction Design Principles
The two-layer explanation system (evidence + descriptions) demonstrates **progressive disclosure** in UX design:
- **Primary Layer**: Concise concept descriptions for quick scanning
- **Secondary Layer**: Detailed evidence for deep investigation
- **Tertiary Layer**: Full PDF context for complete verification

## Academic Quality Standards

### Evidence Validation Criteria
1. **Accuracy** - Evidence correctly represents concept usage
2. **Completeness** - All significant mentions are captured
3. **Context** - Sufficient surrounding text for understanding
4. **Traceability** - Precise links to source material
5. **Quality** - Ranked by relevance and informativeness

### Documentation Requirements
- **Algorithm transparency** for evidence selection
- **Quality metrics** explanation and validation
- **PDF linking** technical specifications
- **User workflow** documentation for researchers

This evidence extraction system provides the foundation for academic trust by ensuring every concept can be independently verified against source material.
