# AI Agent Instructions: Introduction and Problem Overview Analysis

## Academic Context and Learning Objectives

**For Students**: This document analyzes the foundational problem that motivates our entire concept extraction system. In computer science, we often start complex projects by clearly defining the problem space, success criteria, and constraints. This systematic approach prevents "scope creep" and ensures our technical solutions actually solve the right problems.

**Domain Knowledge**: Concept extraction is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that focuses on identifying key ideas, themes, and terminology from text. Unlike simple keyword extraction, concept extraction aims to understand semantic relationships and build knowledge structures that capture domain expertise.

Automated Concept Extraction and Hierarchical Concept Mapping from Research Papers

Introduction and Problem Overview

Researchers face an ever-growing volume of literature, making it challenging to stay current on all relevant concepts and developments. To alleviate this, we propose an automated pipeline that extracts key concepts from a collection of research papers and organizes them into a hierarchical concept map. Each node in this concept map represents a concept (topic, method, idea, etc.), with higher-level nodes grouping related sub-concepts. The map can be visualized interactively (e.g. via D3.js) to allow zooming into finer-grained topics, with node size or color indicating the number of papers supporting that concept. Clicking a node would reveal a description of the concept along with evidence sentences drawn directly from the papers (and links to those papers), to maintain traceability and trust.

Goals: The primary goal is to produce an accurate concept hierarchy that faithfully represents the themes in the paper collection. Equally important are explainability and reproducibility: domain experts (academics) must be able to inspect how the concepts were identified and organized, and verify that each concept is grounded in the source texts. This means favoring methods that are transparent (or can provide supporting evidence) and deterministic. We also seek a solution that is robust (works across different domains or subfields) and repeatable with minimal manual tuning, so that new caches of papers can be processed in the same way.

Scope: Our focus is on the NLP pipeline for concept mining from the papers. This includes text processing, concept extraction, concept deduplication and hierarchy induction, and linking concepts to evidence in the text. The visualization (e.g. using D3.js) is an important application of the output, but the core challenge is building the structured concept map data behind it.

## Critical Analysis and Requirements Extraction

### Problem Statement Decomposition
1. **Information Overload Challenge**: Academic researchers cannot manually process the exponentially growing literature
2. **Knowledge Organization Need**: Raw papers need transformation into structured, navigable concept hierarchies  
3. **Trust and Transparency**: Academic users require explainable, evidence-backed results (not "black box" AI)
4. **Scalability Requirement**: Solution must work across domains with minimal manual configuration

### Success Criteria Identification
- **Accuracy**: Concept hierarchy must faithfully represent themes in paper collection
- **Explainability**: Every concept decision must be traceable to source evidence
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic results that can be verified by domain experts
- **Robustness**: Works across different research domains and subfields
- **Usability**: Minimal manual tuning required for new paper collections

## Academic Learning Outcomes

After implementing these components, students will understand:

1. **Problem-Driven Development**: How to translate academic research problems into software requirements
2. **Domain Modeling**: Representing complex academic requirements as code structures  
3. **Value Object Pattern**: Creating immutable domain concepts that capture business rules
4. **Academic Software Standards**: Why academic software needs higher transparency/reproducibility standards
5. **Validation Patterns**: How to verify software actually solves the intended problem

This foundational work ensures our concept extraction system remains focused on solving real academic research challenges rather than just implementing interesting NLP techniques.
