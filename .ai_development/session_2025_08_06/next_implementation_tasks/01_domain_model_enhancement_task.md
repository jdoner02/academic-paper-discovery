# Task 01: Domain Model Enhancement for Evidence-Based Concept Grounding

## Priority: HIGH (TDD Cycle 1)
**Estimated Time**: 4-6 hours  
**Prerequisites**: Completed concept extraction analysis files  
**Dependencies**: None - foundational work

## Objective
Enhance the existing domain model to support evidence-based concept grounding, hierarchical relationships, and academic-grade explainability as identified in the concept extraction analysis.

## Current State Assessment
Based on analysis of `/Users/jessicadoner/Projects/research-papers/research-paper-aggregator/src/domain/`:

### Existing Components ✅
- `entities/concept.py` - Basic concept entity exists
- `entities/research_paper.py` - Paper entity with metadata
- `value_objects/embedding_vector.py` - Vector representation support
- `value_objects/keyword_config.py` - Configuration management

### Missing Critical Components ❌
- Evidence sentence tracking and linking
- Hierarchical concept relationships (parent/child)
- Concept extraction confidence scoring
- Hierarchy quality metrics and metadata
- Extraction provenance tracking

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Enhanced Value Objects (Red Phase)
Create comprehensive tests for new value objects:

```python
# Test file: tests/unit/domain/value_objects/test_evidence_sentence.py
class TestEvidenceSentence:
    def test_create_evidence_sentence_with_valid_data(self):
        # Test evidence sentence creation with all required fields
        
    def test_evidence_sentence_immutability(self):
        # Test that evidence sentences are immutable value objects
        
    def test_evidence_sentence_equality_based_on_content(self):
        # Test value object equality semantics
```

**Files to Create**:
- `src/domain/value_objects/evidence_sentence.py`
- `src/domain/value_objects/hierarchy_metadata.py`
- `src/domain/value_objects/extraction_provenance.py`
- `src/domain/value_objects/concept_confidence_score.py`

### 2. Enhanced Concept Entity (Green Phase)
Extend existing concept entity with hierarchical and evidence support:

```python
# Enhance: src/domain/entities/concept.py
class Concept:
    """
    Enhanced concept entity with hierarchical relationships and evidence grounding.
    
    Educational Notes:
    - Demonstrates entity pattern in Clean Architecture
    - Shows how to model hierarchical relationships in domain objects
    - Illustrates evidence-based grounding for academic trust
    """
    def __init__(
        self,
        concept_id: str,
        name: str,
        parent_concept_id: Optional[str] = None,
        evidence_sentences: List[EvidenceSentence] = None,
        confidence_score: ConceptConfidenceScore = None,
        extraction_provenance: ExtractionProvenance = None
    ):
        # Implementation with full validation
        
    def add_evidence_sentence(self, evidence: EvidenceSentence) -> None:
        """Add supporting evidence with validation."""
        
    def set_parent_concept(self, parent_id: str) -> None:
        """Establish hierarchical relationship."""
        
    def get_evidence_for_paper(self, paper_id: str) -> List[EvidenceSentence]:
        """Get all evidence from specific paper."""
```

### 3. New Concept Hierarchy Aggregate Root (Refactor Phase)
Create new aggregate root for managing concept hierarchies:

```python
# Create: src/domain/entities/concept_hierarchy.py
class ConceptHierarchy:
    """
    Aggregate root for managing hierarchical concept structures.
    
    Educational Notes:
    - Demonstrates aggregate root pattern from DDD
    - Shows how to maintain consistency across related entities
    - Illustrates tree data structure management in domain layer
    """
    def __init__(
        self,
        hierarchy_id: str,
        root_concepts: List[Concept],
        metadata: HierarchyMetadata
    ):
        # Implementation with hierarchy validation
        
    def add_concept_with_parent(self, concept: Concept, parent_id: str) -> None:
        """Add concept maintaining hierarchy integrity."""
        
    def validate_hierarchy_consistency(self) -> List[str]:
        """Validate no cycles and proper tree structure."""
        
    def get_concepts_at_level(self, level: int) -> List[Concept]:
        """Get all concepts at specific hierarchy level."""
```

## Test Strategy

### Unit Tests (Red Phase)
```bash
# Run tests to see current failures
python -m pytest tests/unit/domain/value_objects/ -v
python -m pytest tests/unit/domain/entities/test_concept.py -v
```

### Property-Based Tests
```python
# Add property-based tests for hierarchy validation
from hypothesis import given, strategies as st

@given(st.lists(st.text(min_size=1), min_size=1, max_size=10))
def test_concept_hierarchy_maintains_tree_properties(concept_names):
    # Test that randomly generated hierarchies maintain tree properties
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# Test evidence linking across papers and concepts
def test_evidence_sentence_links_to_source_paper():
    # Verify evidence sentences properly link back to source papers
```

## Educational Documentation Requirements

Each new component must include:

1. **Academic Context**: Why this component is needed for research applications
2. **Design Patterns**: Which patterns are demonstrated and why
3. **Cross-Disciplinary Notes**: Explanations for non-CS students
4. **Integration Points**: How components work together
5. **Example Usage**: Concrete examples with academic paper scenarios

## Validation Criteria

### Functional Requirements ✅
- [ ] Evidence sentences link to specific PDF pages and paragraphs
- [ ] Concept hierarchies maintain tree structure consistency
- [ ] Confidence scores reflect extraction quality
- [ ] All concepts maintain traceability to source texts

### Quality Requirements ✅
- [ ] >90% test coverage on new domain components
- [ ] All components have comprehensive docstrings
- [ ] Property-based tests validate invariants

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Red Phase (Write Failing Tests)
1. Create test files for all new value objects
2. Write tests for enhanced concept entity functionality
3. Create tests for concept hierarchy aggregate root
4. Run tests to confirm they fail appropriately

### Step 2: Green Phase (Minimal Implementation)
1. Implement `EvidenceSentence` value object
2. Implement `HierarchyMetadata` value object
3. Enhance `Concept` entity with new properties and methods
4. Create `ConceptHierarchy` aggregate root
5. Ensure all tests pass

### Step 3: Refactor Phase (Improve Design)
1. Add comprehensive educational documentation
2. Optimize performance for large concept sets
3. Add validation helpers and utility methods
4. Create factory methods for common usage patterns
