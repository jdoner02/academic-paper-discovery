- **Interface Segregation**: Contract tests ensure interfaces contain only necessary methods
- **Liskov Substitution**: Repository contract tests ensure implementations are interchangeable

### Professional Testing Practices
The framework demonstrates industry-standard testing approaches:

- **Test Pyramid Structure**: Balanced distribution of test types by speed and scope
- **Mock-Based Testing**: Proper isolation of units under test
- **Property-Based Testing**: Value object contracts ensure mathematical properties
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Quantitative quality gates for system performance
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Each test includes educational explanations

### Domain-Driven Design Testing
Tests validate domain concepts effectively:

- **Value Object Testing**: Immutability, equality, and hashability contracts
- **Entity Testing**: Identity and lifecycle management
- **Domain Service Testing**: Business logic orchestration
- **Repository Testing**: Data access abstraction and encapsulation
