## Domain-Specific Context

### Medical Terminology
- R-R intervals: Time between consecutive heartbeats
- RMSSD: Root mean square of successive differences
- pNN50: Percentage of successive R-R intervals >50ms apart
- SDNN: Standard deviation of all R-R intervals
- LF/HF ratio: Low frequency to high frequency power ratio

### Research Context
- TBI: Traumatic Brain Injury
- ANS: Autonomic Nervous System
- HRV: Heart Rate Variability
- ECG: Electrocardiogram
- PPG: Photoplethysmography (Apple Watch method)

### Technical Standards
- Sampling rates: 250Hz minimum for HRV analysis
- Recording duration: 5 minutes minimum for frequency analysis
- Data quality: >80% valid intervals required
- Statistical power: Minimum 20 subjects per group recommended

## Example Usage Patterns

### When working on data validation:
```python
# Copilot will understand this context and provide medical-appropriate validation
def validate_ecg_signal(signal, sampling_rate):
    # Should implement physiological range checking
    # Should detect and flag artifacts
    # Should calculate signal quality metrics
```

### When implementing HRV calculations:
```python  
# Copilot will provide research-grade implementations
def calculate_time_domain_hrv(rr_intervals):
    # Should follow established medical algorithms
    # Should include proper error handling
    # Should validate input data ranges
```

### When creating statistical analyses:
```python
# Copilot will suggest appropriate statistical methods
def compare_hrv_groups(control_data, patient_data):
    # Should test for normality first
    # Should use appropriate statistical tests
    # Should calculate effect sizes
    # Should handle multiple comparisons
```

## Research Quality Guidelines

Always ensure:
1. **Reproducibility**: Use fixed random seeds, document all parameters
2. **Medical Accuracy**: Validate against published algorithms and normal ranges
3. **Statistical Rigor**: Use appropriate tests, report effect sizes and confidence intervals
4. **Data Quality**: Implement robust validation and quality assessment
5. **Documentation**: Include clinical context and interpretation guidelines
