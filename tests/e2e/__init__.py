End-to-End Tests - Complete user workflow validation.

End-to-end tests validate complete user workflows from start to finish,
including CLI interaction, configuration loading, search execution, and
file downloads. These tests ensure that all system components work together
to deliver user value.

Educational Notes:
- E2E tests validate complete user journeys
- They test system integration from user perspective
- Focus on real-world usage scenarios
- Validate that architectural components deliver business value

E2E Test Categories:
1. CLI Workflow Tests: Command-line interface interactions
2. Complete Research Workflows: Full paper discovery and download
3. Performance Tests: Large-scale operations and resource usage

Testing Philosophy:
- Test from user perspective, not implementation details
- Use realistic data and scenarios
- Validate end-user value delivery
- Test both successful workflows and error recovery

Directory Structure:
- cli/: Command-line interface testing
- workflows/: Complete user scenario validation
- performance/: Large-scale operation testing
