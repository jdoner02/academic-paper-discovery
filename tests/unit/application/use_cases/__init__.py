"""
Use Case Tests - Validating business operation orchestration.

Use cases represent the primary business operations of our application. They are responsible
for coordinating domain objects and orchestrating complex workflows. These tests ensure
that use cases properly delegate work to domain services and repositories while maintaining
proper separation of concerns.

Educational Notes:
- Use cases are the entry points for business operations
- They should not contain business logic - that belongs in domain objects
- Use cases coordinate between domain objects and infrastructure
- These tests use mocks to isolate the use case from its dependencies

Testing Patterns:
1. Mock all external dependencies (repositories, services)
2. Verify correct delegation to domain objects
3. Test error handling and edge cases
4. Ensure proper input validation
5. Validate return values and exceptions

Design Pattern: Command Pattern
Use cases implement the Command pattern, encapsulating business operations
as objects that can be parameterized and executed.
