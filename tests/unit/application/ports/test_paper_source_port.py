Unit tests for PaperSourcePort - Multi-source repository abstraction.

This module demonstrates the Repository Pattern extended for multi-source
academic paper aggregation. The PaperSourcePort provides a unified interface
for accessing papers from different academic databases (ArXiv, PubMed, Google Scholar).

Educational Notes:
- Repository Pattern abstracts data access across multiple external APIs
- Port/Adapter Pattern enables pluggable source implementations
- Clean Architecture principle: outer layers depend on inner abstractions
- Each source maintains its specific metadata and capabilities

Design Patterns Demonstrated:
- Repository Pattern: Unified data access interface
- Port/Adapter Pattern: External system integration
- Strategy Pattern: Source-specific search strategies
- Value Object Pattern: Source-specific metadata preservation

Testing Strategy:
Following TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle:
1. Write failing test defining desired behavior
2. Implement minimal code to pass test
3. Refactor while maintaining passing tests

Architecture Note:
This extends the existing PaperRepositoryPort to support multiple sources
while maintaining backward compatibility and educational clarity.
