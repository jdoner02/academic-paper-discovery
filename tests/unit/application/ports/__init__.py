Port Tests - Validating abstract interfaces and contracts.

Ports define the abstract interfaces that allow our application to interact with
external systems while maintaining the Dependency Inversion Principle. These tests
ensure that our port definitions are correct and that implementations properly
fulfill their contracts.

Educational Notes:
- Ports are abstract interfaces that define contracts
- They enable dependency inversion and testability
- Port tests verify interface definitions and contract compliance
- These tests help ensure Liskov Substitution Principle adherence

Design Pattern: Adapter Pattern
Ports define the target interface that external adapters must implement,
allowing our application to work with various external systems through
a common interface.

Testing Philosophy:
Port tests should verify:
1. Interface method signatures are correct
2. Abstract methods raise NotImplementedError appropriately
3. Any concrete methods in ports work as expected
4. Type hints and documentation are accurate
