Repository Tests - Validating data access implementations.

Repositories implement the Repository pattern, providing a collection-like
interface for accessing domain objects while hiding the details of data
storage and retrieval. These tests ensure that repository implementations
correctly fulfill their port contracts and handle data operations properly.

Educational Notes:
- Repository Pattern abstracts data access behind domain-friendly interfaces
- Repositories act as in-memory collections of domain objects
- They translate between domain objects and storage representations
- Enable easy testing by allowing in-memory implementations

Design Pattern: Repository Pattern
- Encapsulates data access logic
- Provides collection-like interface for domain objects
- Enables easy swapping of data storage mechanisms
- Supports both query and persistence operations

Testing Strategies:
1. Mock external data sources (databases, APIs, files)
2. Test both successful operations and error scenarios
3. Verify proper domain object construction from external data
4. Ensure proper handling of not-found scenarios
5. Test query parameter validation and filtering

Repository Implementation Types:
- In-Memory: Simple implementations using Python collections
- Database: SQL or NoSQL database implementations
- API: External service integrations
- File: File system-based storage

Testing Focus:
1. Port contract compliance
2. Data transformation accuracy
3. Error handling for external failures
4. Query parameter validation
5. Performance considerations for large datasets
