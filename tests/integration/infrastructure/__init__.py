"""
Infrastructure Layer Integration Tests.

These tests validate that infrastructure components properly integrate with
external systems and correctly implement the port interfaces defined by the
application layer. They focus on external system integration patterns.

Educational Notes:
- Infrastructure tests validate external system integration
- They test adapter implementations against port contracts
- Focus on network, file system, and API integration
- Test both success and failure scenarios for external dependencies

Testing Focus:
- Repository implementations with external APIs
- File system integration with domain services
- Network resilience and error handling
- Configuration system integration with external files
