"""
GUI Services and Configuration Tests - Academic Research Interface

This module tests the service layer and configuration components of the GUI,
focusing on Clean Architecture compliance and proper separation of concerns.

Educational Notes:
- Demonstrates testing of service layer components in web applications
- Shows validation of configuration management and dependency injection
- Tests adapter pattern implementation for external service integration
- Validates proper abstraction boundaries in Clean Architecture

Testing Approach:
- Service Contract Testing: Validate interface compliance and behavior
- Configuration Testing: Ensure proper settings management and validation
- Integration Testing: Test service coordination and data flow
- Error Handling Testing: Validate graceful failure and recovery patterns

Design Patterns Tested:
- Adapter Pattern: Service adapters for external API integration
- Factory Pattern: Service creation and configuration
- Strategy Pattern: Pluggable service implementations
- Dependency Injection: Proper service composition and lifecycle management
