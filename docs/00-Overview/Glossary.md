# Glossary - Academic Paper Discovery System

## Overview

This glossary defines domain terminology and technical concepts used throughout the Academic Paper Discovery System. Each term includes its definition, context, and relationships to other concepts.

## Domain Terminology

### Academic Research Domain

**Academic Paper**
: A scholarly document containing original research, typically peer-reviewed and published in academic journals or conferences. In our system, represented by the [[Research-Paper-Entity]].

**Concept Extraction**
: The process of identifying and extracting key ideas, topics, and themes from academic literature using natural language processing and machine learning techniques. See [[Concept-Extraction]].

**Research Domain**
: A specific field of academic study (e.g., "Heart Rate Variability", "Machine Learning", "Neuroscience") with its own vocabulary, methodologies, and literature patterns. Configured via [[Research-Domain-Configuration]].

**Semantic Search**
: Search methodology that understands the meaning and context of queries rather than just matching keywords. Implemented through [[Embedding-Services]].

**Citation Network**
: Graph structure representing relationships between papers through citations, enabling discovery of related work and influential papers.

**Knowledge Graph**
: Network representation of entities (papers, concepts, authors) and their relationships, enabling semantic discovery and analysis.

### System Architecture

**Clean Architecture**
: Architectural pattern that separates business logic from external concerns through layered design. See [[Clean-Architecture-Implementation]].

**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**
: Software development approach that models complex domains through rich domain objects and services. Applied in our [[02-Domain]] layer.

**Hexagonal Architecture**
: Architectural pattern that isolates core business logic from external dependencies through ports and adapters. See [[Port-Interfaces]].

**Bounded Context**
: DDD concept defining explicit boundaries within which a domain model is defined and applicable.

### Technical Components

**Entity**
: Domain object with unique identity that persists over time. Example: [[Research-Paper-Entity]] with DOI as identity.

**Value Object**
: Immutable domain object defined by its attributes rather than identity. Example: [[Search-Query-ValueObject]].

**Aggregate**
: Cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit for data changes, ensuring consistency boundaries.

**Repository Pattern**
: Design pattern that encapsulates data access logic and provides a uniform interface for accessing domain objects. See [[Repository-Implementation]].

**Use Case**
: Application service that orchestrates domain objects to fulfill a specific business requirement. See [[Paper-Discovery-UseCase]].

**Port**
: Interface defining contracts between application core and external systems. See [[Port-Interfaces]].

**Adapter**
: Implementation of a port that connects to specific external systems or technologies.

### Data and Processing

**Embedding Vector**
: High-dimensional numerical representation of text that captures semantic meaning, enabling similarity comparisons.

**Vector Similarity**
: Mathematical measure of how similar two embedding vectors are, typically using cosine similarity or Euclidean distance.

**Batch Processing**
: Processing large volumes of data in discrete chunks rather than individual items, optimizing for throughput.

**Incremental Processing**
: Processing strategy that only handles new or changed data since the last run, optimizing for efficiency.

**Caching Strategy**
: Systematic approach to storing frequently accessed data in fast storage for improved performance. See [[Caching-Strategy]].

### Configuration and Management

**YAML Configuration**
: Human-readable data serialization format used for defining research domain parameters and system settings.

**Feature Flags**
: Runtime configuration mechanism that enables or disables specific functionality without code deployment. See [[Feature-Flags]].

**Environment Configuration**
: Set of configuration parameters specific to deployment environments (development, staging, production).

**Validation Rules**
: Logic that ensures configuration data meets required format and business rules before system use.

### Quality Assurance

**Test Double**
: Generic term for any object used in place of a real object for testing purposes (mocks, stubs, fakes).

**Mock Object**
: Test double that verifies interactions between components during testing.

**Test Fixture**
: Fixed state of a set of objects used as baseline for running tests consistently.

**Integration Test**
: Test that verifies correct interaction between multiple system components.

**End-to-End Test**
: Test that validates complete user workflows from start to finish.

**Property-Based Testing**
: Testing methodology that verifies code properties hold for a wide range of inputs.

### Operations and Deployment

**Containerization**
: Packaging applications and dependencies into lightweight, portable containers. See [[Containerization]].

**CI/CD Pipeline**
: Automated process for building, testing, and deploying software changes. See [[CI-CD-Pipeline]].

**Observability**
: Ability to understand system internal state from external outputs (logs, metrics, traces).

**Monitoring**
: Continuous observation of system health and performance metrics.

**Blue-Green Deployment**
: Deployment strategy that reduces downtime by maintaining two identical production environments.

## Technical Patterns

**Strategy Pattern**
: Behavioral design pattern that enables selecting algorithms at runtime by encapsulating them in separate classes.

**Factory Pattern**
: Creational design pattern that provides interface for creating objects without specifying their exact classes.

**Observer Pattern**
: Behavioral design pattern that defines subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects about events.

**Command Pattern**
: Behavioral design pattern that encapsulates requests as objects, enabling parameterization and queuing.

**Decorator Pattern**
: Structural design pattern that adds new functionality to objects without altering their structure.

## API and Integration Terms

**RESTful API**
: Architectural style for web services that follows REST principles for resource manipulation.

**Rate Limiting**
: Controlling the rate of requests to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage.

**Circuit Breaker**
: Design pattern that prevents cascading failures by stopping calls to failing services.

**Exponential Backoff**
: Algorithm that increases delay between retry attempts exponentially.

**Idempotency**
: Property where multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

## Performance Terms

**Throughput**
: Number of operations completed per unit of time.

**Latency**
: Time delay between request initiation and response completion.

**Scalability**
: System's ability to handle increased load by adding resources.

**Load Balancing**
: Distributing workload across multiple computing resources.

**Caching**
: Storing frequently accessed data in fast storage for improved performance.
