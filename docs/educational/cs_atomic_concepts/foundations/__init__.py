Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science

This package contains the fundamental mathematical concepts that underlie
all computer science data structures, algorithms, and computational thinking.

Educational Philosophy:
    "Before we can build computational structures, we must understand
     the mathematical foundations upon which they rest."

Package Contents:
    üìÅ set_theory.py       - Sets as collections of distinct elements
    üìÅ logic.py           - Boolean logic and propositional calculus
    üìÅ relations.py       - Mathematical relations and their properties
    üìÅ functions.py       - Mathematical functions and mappings
    üìÅ graph_theory.py    - Graphs, vertices, edges, and connectivity
    üìÅ number_theory.py   - Numbers, arithmetic, and mathematical proofs

Learning Sequence:
    The concepts in this package build upon each other in a specific order
    designed for maximum pedagogical value:

    1. set_theory    ‚Üí Everything starts with collections of objects
    2. logic         ‚Üí Rules for reasoning about sets and membership
    3. relations     ‚Üí How sets can be related to each other
    4. functions     ‚Üí Special relations with unique mappings
    5. graph_theory  ‚Üí Sets with connectivity structure
    6. number_theory ‚Üí Discrete mathematics for algorithm analysis

Real-World Connection:
    These mathematical foundations appear everywhere in computer science:
    ‚Ä¢ Databases use set theory (SQL operations)
    ‚Ä¢ Programming uses logic (if statements, boolean expressions)
    ‚Ä¢ Data structures use relations (parent-child in trees)
    ‚Ä¢ Algorithms use functions (input ‚Üí output mappings)
    ‚Ä¢ Networks use graph theory (routing, social networks)
    ‚Ä¢ Cryptography uses number theory (RSA, prime numbers)

Course Alignment:
    CSCD 210: set_theory, logic, relations
    CSCD 211: functions, graph_theory basics
    CSCD 320: advanced graph_theory, number_theory
    MATH 161: All concepts with formal mathematical rigor

Prerequisites:
    High school algebra and basic logical reasoning.
    No prior programming experience required.
