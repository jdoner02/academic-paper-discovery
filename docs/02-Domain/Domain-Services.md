# Domain Services - Business Logic Coordination

## Context & Purpose

**Domain Services** represent business operations that don't naturally belong to any specific [[Research-Paper-Entity]] or [[Search-Query-ValueObject]]. They orchestrate complex domain logic that spans multiple entities or requires specialized algorithms that would be inappropriate to embed within entities themselves.

In academic research systems, domain services handle operations like:
- Complex similarity calculations between research papers
- Multi-criteria ranking algorithms for search results  
- Citation network analysis across paper collections
- Concept extraction and relationship mapping

## Core Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle
Each domain service focuses on one specific business capability:

```python
class PaperSimilarityService:
    """Calculates semantic similarity between research papers"""
    
    def calculate_similarity(self, paper1: ResearchPaper, paper2: ResearchPaper) -> float:
        # Complex algorithm implementation
        pass

class CitationAnalysisService:
    """Analyzes citation patterns and academic impact"""
    
    def calculate_impact_score(self, paper: ResearchPaper) -> float:
        # Citation network analysis
        pass
```

### Domain Purity
Domain services contain **pure business logic** with no infrastructure dependencies:

```python
# ✅ CORRECT: Pure domain logic
class ConceptExtractionService:
    def extract_concepts(self, abstract: str, keywords: List[str]) -> Set[Concept]:
        # Business logic for concept identification
        return self._apply_domain_rules(abstract, keywords)

# ❌ INCORRECT: Infrastructure coupling
class ConceptExtractionService:
    def extract_concepts(self, paper_id: str) -> Set[Concept]:
        paper = database.get_paper(paper_id)  # Infrastructure dependency!
        return self._apply_domain_rules(paper.abstract, paper.keywords)
```

### Statelessness
Domain services should be stateless and side-effect free:

```python
class PaperRankingService:
    """Stateless service for ranking research papers"""
    
    def rank_by_relevance(self, papers: List[ResearchPaper], 
                         query: SearchQuery) -> List[RankedPaper]:
        # Pure function - same inputs always produce same outputs
        scores = [self._calculate_relevance(paper, query) for paper in papers]
        return self._sort_by_score(papers, scores)
```

## Implementation Patterns

### Service Interface Pattern
Define abstract interfaces for domain services to enable testing and flexibility:

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class PaperAnalysisService(ABC):
    """Abstract interface for paper analysis operations"""
    
    @abstractmethod
    def analyze_research_impact(self, paper: ResearchPaper) -> ImpactMetrics:
        """Calculate multi-dimensional impact metrics"""
        pass
    
    @abstractmethod
    def identify_research_gaps(self, papers: List[ResearchPaper]) -> List[ResearchGap]:
        """Identify under-researched areas in paper collection"""
        pass

class StandardPaperAnalysisService(PaperAnalysisService):
    """Production implementation of paper analysis"""
    
    def analyze_research_impact(self, paper: ResearchPaper) -> ImpactMetrics:
        citation_impact = self._calculate_citation_impact(paper)
        novelty_score = self._assess_novelty(paper)
        methodology_rigor = self._evaluate_methodology(paper)
        
        return ImpactMetrics(
            citation_impact=citation_impact,
            novelty_score=novelty_score,
            methodology_rigor=methodology_rigor,
            overall_score=self._weighted_average([citation_impact, novelty_score, methodology_rigor])
        )
```

### Factory Pattern for Algorithm Selection
Use factories to select appropriate algorithms based on research domain:

```python
class SimilarityServiceFactory:
    """Factory for domain-specific similarity algorithms"""
    
    @staticmethod
    def create_for_domain(research_domain: ResearchDomain) -> PaperSimilarityService:
        if research_domain == ResearchDomain.COMPUTER_SCIENCE:
            return ComputerScienceSimilarityService()
        elif research_domain == ResearchDomain.MEDICAL_RESEARCH:
            return MedicalResearchSimilarityService()
        elif research_domain == ResearchDomain.PHYSICS:
            return PhysicsSimilarityService()
        else:
            return GenericSimilarityService()

class ComputerScienceSimilarityService(PaperSimilarityService):
    """CS-specific similarity using code similarity, algorithm analysis"""
    
    def calculate_similarity(self, paper1: ResearchPaper, paper2: ResearchPaper) -> float:
        # Domain-specific similarity calculation
        algorithm_similarity = self._compare_algorithms(paper1, paper2)
        implementation_similarity = self._compare_implementations(paper1, paper2)
        dataset_similarity = self._compare_datasets(paper1, paper2)
        
        return self._weighted_combination(algorithm_similarity, implementation_similarity, dataset_similarity)
```

### Command Pattern for Complex Operations
Encapsulate complex business operations as command objects:

```python
class AnalyzePaperCollectionCommand:
    """Command object for comprehensive paper collection analysis"""
    
    def __init__(self, papers: List[ResearchPaper], analysis_config: AnalysisConfig):
        self.papers = papers
        self.analysis_config = analysis_config
        self.similarity_service = PaperSimilarityService()
        self.ranking_service = PaperRankingService()
        self.gap_analysis_service = ResearchGapAnalysisService()
    
    def execute(self) -> CollectionAnalysisResult:
        """Execute comprehensive analysis workflow"""
        # Step 1: Calculate pairwise similarities
        similarity_matrix = self._build_similarity_matrix()
        
        # Step 2: Identify paper clusters
        clusters = self._identify_research_clusters(similarity_matrix)
        
        # Step 3: Rank papers within clusters
        ranked_clusters = self._rank_papers_in_clusters(clusters)
        
        # Step 4: Identify research gaps
        research_gaps = self.gap_analysis_service.identify_gaps(self.papers)
        
        return CollectionAnalysisResult(
            similarity_matrix=similarity_matrix,
            research_clusters=ranked_clusters,
            research_gaps=research_gaps,
            analysis_metadata=self._generate_metadata()
        )
```

## Integration with Other Domain Concepts

### Relationship to [[Research-Paper-Entity]]
Domain services **operate on** entities but don't **own** them:

```python
class PaperValidationService:
    """Validates research papers against domain rules"""
    
    def validate_paper(self, paper: ResearchPaper) -> ValidationResult:
        errors = []
        
        # Business rule: Papers must have meaningful abstracts
        if len(paper.abstract.strip()) < 100:
            errors.append("Abstract too short for meaningful analysis")
        
        # Business rule: Keywords must be relevant to content
        if not self._keywords_match_content(paper.keywords, paper.abstract):
            errors.append("Keywords don't match abstract content")
        
        return ValidationResult(is_valid=len(errors) == 0, errors=errors)
    
    def _keywords_match_content(self, keywords: List[str], abstract: str) -> bool:
        # Complex domain logic for keyword-content matching
        pass
```

### Collaboration with [[Search-Query-ValueObject]]
Services use value objects as parameters while maintaining immutability:

```python
class SearchOptimizationService:
    """Optimizes search queries for better results"""
    
    def optimize_query(self, original_query: SearchQuery) -> SearchQuery:
        # Analyze original query
        expanded_terms = self._expand_search_terms(original_query.terms)
        refined_filters = self._refine_filters(original_query.filters)
        
        # Create new optimized query (value objects are immutable)
        return SearchQuery(
            terms=expanded_terms,
            filters=refined_filters,
            date_range=original_query.date_range,
            max_results=original_query.max_results
        )
```

### Triggering [[Domain-Events]]
Domain services can trigger domain events for significant business occurrences:

```python
class PaperDiscoveryService:
    """Orchestrates the paper discovery workflow"""
    
    def __init__(self, event_publisher: DomainEventPublisher):
        self.event_publisher = event_publisher
    
    def discover_related_papers(self, seed_paper: ResearchPaper) -> List[ResearchPaper]:
        # Perform discovery
        related_papers = self._find_related_papers(seed_paper)
        
        # Trigger domain event
        self.event_publisher.publish(
            PapersDiscoveredEvent(
                seed_paper_id=seed_paper.id,
                discovered_papers=[p.id for p in related_papers],
                discovery_method="semantic_similarity",
                timestamp=datetime.now()
            )
        )
        
        return related_papers
```

## Educational Design Principles

### Demonstrating SOLID Principles

**Single Responsibility**: Each service has one reason to change
**Open/Closed**: Services are open for extension via inheritance, closed for modification
**Liskov Substitution**: Service implementations can be substituted without breaking clients
**Interface Segregation**: Service interfaces are focused and cohesive
**Dependency Inversion**: Services depend on abstractions, not concretions

### Real-World Applications

**Academic Research**: Paper similarity, citation analysis, research gap identification
**Industry Applications**: Product recommendation, content analysis, knowledge discovery
**Medical Research**: Patient cohort analysis, treatment effectiveness, research synthesis

## Testing Strategies

### Unit Testing Domain Services
```python
class TestPaperSimilarityService:
    def test_identical_papers_have_maximum_similarity(self):
        # Arrange
        service = PaperSimilarityService()
        paper = ResearchPaper(title="Test", abstract="Abstract", keywords=["AI"])
        
        # Act
        similarity = service.calculate_similarity(paper, paper)
        
        # Assert
        assert similarity == 1.0, "Identical papers should have similarity of 1.0"
    
    def test_completely_different_papers_have_minimum_similarity(self):
        # Arrange
        service = PaperSimilarityService()
        cs_paper = ResearchPaper(title="Machine Learning", abstract="AI algorithms", keywords=["AI"])
        bio_paper = ResearchPaper(title="Cell Biology", abstract="Cellular processes", keywords=["biology"])
        
        # Act
        similarity = service.calculate_similarity(cs_paper, bio_paper)
        
        # Assert
        assert similarity < 0.1, "Unrelated papers should have very low similarity"
```

### Property-Based Testing
```python
import hypothesis
from hypothesis import strategies as st

class TestPaperRankingService:
    @hypothesis.given(
        papers=st.lists(st.builds(ResearchPaper), min_size=1, max_size=100),
        query=st.builds(SearchQuery)
    )
    def test_ranking_always_returns_same_count(self, papers, query):
        service = PaperRankingService()
        ranked_papers = service.rank_by_relevance(papers, query)
        assert len(ranked_papers) == len(papers)
    
    @hypothesis.given(
        papers=st.lists(st.builds(ResearchPaper), min_size=2, max_size=10),
        query=st.builds(SearchQuery)
    )
    def test_ranking_is_stable_and_deterministic(self, papers, query):
        service = PaperRankingService()
        ranking1 = service.rank_by_relevance(papers, query)
        ranking2 = service.rank_by_relevance(papers, query)
        assert ranking1 == ranking2, "Rankings should be deterministic"
```

## Trade-offs and Design Decisions

### Service Granularity
**Fine-grained services**: Easy to test, single responsibility, but may lead to service proliferation
**Coarse-grained services**: Fewer services to manage, but risk violating single responsibility

**Decision**: Prefer fine-grained services with clear composition patterns

### Stateless vs Stateful Services
**Stateless**: Thread-safe, easier to test, better for concurrent access
**Stateful**: Can optimize for repeated operations, maintain context

**Decision**: Domain services should be stateless; use caching at infrastructure layer

### Performance vs Purity
**Pure domain logic**: Easy to reason about, test, and maintain
**Performance optimized**: May require infrastructure concerns in domain

**Decision**: Keep domain services pure; handle performance in infrastructure layer

## Extensions and Future Considerations

### Machine Learning Integration
```python
class MLEnhancedSimilarityService(PaperSimilarityService):
    """Similarity service enhanced with machine learning models"""
    
    def __init__(self, embedding_model: TextEmbeddingModel):
        self.embedding_model = embedding_model
    
    def calculate_similarity(self, paper1: ResearchPaper, paper2: ResearchPaper) -> float:
        # Combine traditional similarity with ML embeddings
        traditional_sim = super().calculate_similarity(paper1, paper2)
        embedding_sim = self._calculate_embedding_similarity(paper1, paper2)
        
        return self._weighted_combination(traditional_sim, embedding_sim)
```

### Domain Event Integration
```python
class EventDrivenPaperAnalysisService:
    """Paper analysis service that reacts to domain events"""
    
    def handle_paper_added_event(self, event: PaperAddedEvent):
        # Trigger analysis when new papers are added
        paper = self.paper_repository.get_by_id(event.paper_id)
        analysis_result = self.analyze_paper(paper)
        self.event_publisher.publish(PaperAnalyzedEvent(paper.id, analysis_result))
```
