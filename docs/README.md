# Academic Paper Discovery System - Documentation Knowledge Graph

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for the Academic Paper Discovery System. This documentation serves as both a learning resource and the architectural blueprint for the complete system refactor.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

This documentation system is designed as an **Obsidian-compatible knowledge graph** where each concept is atomic, complete, and interconnected. It serves multiple purposes:

1. **Architectural Blueprint**: Defines the ideal structure for the complete refactor
2. **Pedagogical Resource**: Teaches software engineering principles through practical examples
3. **Implementation Guide**: Provides specific guidance for building each component
4. **Knowledge Graph**: Interconnected concepts that build understanding progressively

## ðŸ”— Navigation Patterns

This documentation uses Obsidian-style linking to create a knowledge graph:

- **[[Concept]]**: Links to related concepts
- **[[Section#Subsection]]**: Links to specific sections
- **Tags**: #architecture #domain #testing for categorization
- **Backlinks**: Show which concepts reference this one

## ðŸŽ“ Educational Approach

Each document follows pedagogical best practices:

1. **Context First**: Why this concept exists and its importance
2. **Principles**: Underlying software engineering principles
3. **Implementation**: Practical code examples and patterns
4. **Trade-offs**: Design decisions and their implications
5. **Extensions**: How to adapt and extend the concept

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **New to the System?** Start with [[System-Vision]] and [[User-Stories]]
2. **Implementing Components?** Begin with [[System-Architecture]] and your specific domain
3. **Contributing?** Review [[Development-Workflow]] and [[Code-Review-Guidelines]]
4. **Deploying?** Follow [[Containerization]] and [[CI-CD-Pipeline]]

## ðŸ“‹ Refactor Roadmap

This documentation defines the target architecture for refactoring from the current mixed structure to a clean, modular system:

### Current State (Mixed Architecture)
```
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py, search_cli.py (root-level scripts)
â”œâ”€â”€ src/ (partial Clean Architecture)
â”œâ”€â”€ pages/ (Next.js frontend mixed with backend)
â””â”€â”€ config/ (domain-specific configurations)
```

### Target State (Clean Separation)
```
â”œâ”€â”€ research-core/ (Python backend with Clean Architecture)
â”œâ”€â”€ research-web/ (Next.js frontend application)
â”œâ”€â”€ shared/ (Configuration and common utilities)
â””â”€â”€ docs/ (Comprehensive knowledge graph)
```

Each documentation file specifies exactly how to implement its concept in the target architecture, ensuring a systematic and educational refactor process.

*This documentation system serves as both a learning resource and implementation guide, demonstrating how comprehensive documentation can drive architectural excellence and serve as a pedagogical masterpiece.*
