# HRV Research Search Keywords Configuration
# 
# This file defines search terms and strategies for automated HRV research
# paper discovery. It demonstrates configuration-driven functionality that
# allows researchers to customize search behavior without code changes.
#
# Educational Notes:
# - YAML format for human-readable configuration
# - Hierarchical organization of search terms
# - Multiple search strategies for different research focuses
# - Extensible structure for adding new keyword categories
